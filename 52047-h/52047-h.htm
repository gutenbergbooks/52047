<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE WALKING HOUSE</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-t.jpg" width="90" height="82" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE doll’s house stood in the most convenient corner of
the nursery, having, like Noah’s dove, found rest only
after a somewhat varied and tempestuous experience.
Sally had not been at all able to make up her mind just
what location suited her best, and the house had patiently traveled,
or, in other words, had been propelled by the united efforts of Bob
and Sally—“The corporal pushed and the sergeant pulled”—the
one dragging, the other pushing, from corner to corner and from
side to side of the spacious room. Not a piece of furniture but
had been moved out of the way that the doll’s house might stand
in its place, and was as methodically moved back again when the
building resumed its travels. Never did it remain in one place for
longer than twenty-four hours, much to the disgust and terror of its
inmates, who were frequently joggled from their chairs and tilted
out of bed as their domicile renewed its pilgrimage. They concluded
by naming it the Walking House, which certainly seemed
appropriate enough under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>Finally, when the Walking House had traveled around the
nursery, Sally decided that the very best position was the one it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at first occupied, a sunny spot between two windows, and at night
lighted from above by a bracket from which depended four electric
bulbs. To be sure, the dresser, to which this post of vantage had
originally belonged, became very sulky at being deprived of her
rights, and purposely twisted off one of her castors while in transit
to the other side of the room. But as nothing in the world was
easier than for John, the man of all work, to screw another castor
in its place, nobody really minded it the least little bit.</p>

<p>A great man by the name of Ruskin once said that “Architecture
is frozen music.” Now the architecture of the Walking
House was no description of music at all, and I have no doubt that
the gentleman who admired Grecian architecture would have held
up both hands in dismay at mentioning architecture and the Walking
House in the same breath. Truth to tell, the building had been
designed by Sally herself, and had been elaborated by John’s handy
fingers from a number of good-sized boxes procured from the grocery
man. The boxes diminished in size as the house soared upward,
the whole terminating in a peaked roof under whose roomy gable
Sally had planned and consummated an attic for her beloved dollies
that would have put to shame the garret of many a grown-up housekeeper.</p>

<p>All the rest of the rooms had been papered by the children’s
deft fingers in neat little designs procured from Mr. Brouse, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gentleman with a wooden leg who lived three blocks away and then
around the corner and up one flight, as he himself was wont to describe
it. And although he really did live up one flight as far
as eating and drinking and sleeping were concerned, the shop was in
reality only up one step—that most fascinating shop, from whose
mysterious recesses might be procured rolls of the most delightful
wall paper, which was surely invented and designed simply and
solely for the decoration of doll houses.</p>

<p>Mr. Brouse was an old soldier, according to his own account,
and indeed was familiarly addressed as “Captain” by his intimate
cronies. He had lost a limb in a mysterious battle, the name of
which, as spoken by himself, Sally had never been able to discover
in any one of several histories of the United States through
which the little girl had patiently toiled in search of it. However,
Sally had unbounded faith in her hero, for such she considered
him to be; and her admiration was returned with interest by
the retired “Captain” who, with his own hands—that, as Bob seriously
remarked, had once wielded a sword—carried to the nursery a
large pail of paste and assisted in hanging the wall paper, and many
a difficult corner he had arranged with neatness and despatch. He
had even tacked up tiny mouldings made from the slender strips of
which wee gilt frames are fashioned. In fact, his work was a
masterpiece of art, and Sally appreciated it hugely, making a shy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
return in the way of fat pin-cushions and sprawling penwipers, and
even a gorgeous silk needlebook, mysterious of design and most difficult
of access as regarding certain wabbly strings and buttons,
which, when once fastened, could never be persuaded to open themselves
again, and behind whose secret fastnesses the needles comfortably
and aimlessly rusted.</p>

<p>So much for the papering of the rooms. When it came to
finishing the attic, why, that was quite another thing. Sally calmly
but firmly declared that it <i>must be plastered</i>, and plastered it was,
but altogether without the assistance of Mr. Brouse, who declared
that matters were growing altogether too complicated for him.
And he politely retired, forgetting his pail of paste, however, into
which nurse presently fell, much to the detriment of her best gloves
which she had put on in order to appear unusually fine on her afternoon
out. Nothing daunted, Sally flew to the cellar and routed out
John, who was taking a bit of a nap in a cosy little den he had fixed
for himself in the furnace room. John was surely an exception to
most people, who are usually cranky at being wakened. He bobbed
up smiling, and readily agreed to attend to plastering the attic of the
Walking House. And in a much shorter time than Sally had really
expected, the whole job was finished and the little room with its
peaked ceiling looked exactly like a really truly attic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/illus008.jpg" width="455" height="595" alt="Children watching man with peg-leg cut paper" />
<div class="caption">The “Captain” assisted in hanging the wall paper.</div>
</div>

<p>The house, as before described, was built of good-sized boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
neatly put together with narrow cleats to hide the joinings, and
the whole was painted a delicate gray, only the sloping roof being
moss green. John had covered this roof with tiny shingles, and the
effect of the whole was extremely attractive. It was divided in
the middle by a broad hall, at the back of which was a wide stairway.
John had rather demurred at the stairway, foreseeing that
the making of it would be a troublesome piece of business. But
Sally had stoutly insisted thereon, for how on earth could a doll
descend from upper stories to lower without stairs? She would be
forced to hurl herself out of the front windows,—called so by compliment
since the whole front of the house stood open in one generous
space—a proceeding extremely detrimental to china limbs.
Sally was a matter-of-fact little soul, albeit she possessed a brilliant
imagination. But she certainly builded better than she knew when
she insisted on that staircase. John, as usual, gave in and the stairs
became an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>The lower floor of the Walking House consisted of a spacious
dining-room on one side of the hall and a kitchen and laundry on
the other. On the next floor were the drawing-room, library and
music-room. On the third floor were three bed-rooms and a bath-room,
and above all, the attic.</p>

<p>On one side of the house and running across the front on the
lower floor, John had built a veranda, on which a doll might enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
coolness and comfort on the hottest of days, while all the way up
the other side ran a tiny fire-escape, which finally disappeared in a
scuttle in the sloping roof.</p>

<p>Bob, just then much interested in electricity, wired the whole
house and connected it with the electric light chandelier which hung
above it, so that every room was brilliantly lighted with electricity,
and an electric bell at the front door gave notice whenever a
friendly doll dropped in for afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Sally’s one regret was that there was no cellar. The child had
dreamed of a wee furnace and a fruit closet filled with jars of jam
and jelly put up over a tiny electric stove. But the stove had been
utterly impracticable, John had declared that it would be impossible
to dig down through the floor of the room for the cellar, and practical
nurse had pointed out the fact that nowhere could one find
preserve jars tiny enough for the purpose. So Sally had given up
the project, not without a sigh however. She had very, very realistic
ideas, had Sally.</p>

<p>One of her pet projects, confided to her governess, Miss Palmer,
not without misgivings, had been to build a revolving house,
one that could be “swung around” as the child, knowing nothing of
pivots, had expressed it. This idea she had conceived to be applied
not only to doll houses, but to real dwellings.</p>

<p>“You could always have the sunshine wherever you wanted it,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she had explained. “And wouldn’t it be fine to have it always right
here in the nursery?”</p>

<p>Miss Palmer had hesitated a little before replying. Indeed
Sally’s theories often caused her to hesitate. However, she finally
explained that the idea would be quite impossible, as all buildings
of any size require a firm foundation. And she thereupon proceeded
to explain the nature of the pivot, considering the opportunity a
very fitting one.</p>

<p>“Besides,” she concluded, “wouldn’t it be very selfish for us to
keep all the sunshine on our side of the house all the time? What
would become of Grandma and Bob?”</p>

<p>Sally was quiet for a moment, thinking.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to be selfish,” she whispered, snuggling her
peachy cheek against her teacher’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you didn’t, my dear,” returned Miss Palmer.</p>

<p>And so it fell out that no architect, not even John, was ever requested
to draw plans for a house that might revolve on a pivot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE HOUSE IS FURNISHED</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-t.jpg" width="90" height="82" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE furnishing of the doll’s house proved a keen delight
to Sally, and the infection spread from the little girl
to the other members of the household, even Papa Doctor
often emerging from his carriage with his arms full
of mysterious, knobby parcels.</p>

<p>Mamma Wee, as Sally lovingly nicknamed Mrs. North, renounced
pink teas and bridge parties and spent hours every day sitting
bow-legged like a Turk or a tailor, while she arranged the fascinating
little rooms, laid small carpets and tacked up tiny, ruffled
curtains. For all the windows were real ones, with panes of glass
let into the small sashes and with the cunningest little white blinds
that opened in the middle and could be securely fastened with bolts
at night. Sally, who, as Bob said, was “always thinking up something
else,” was already revolving in her own mind the propriety
of demanding screens to head off imaginary flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Just fancy how perfectly <i>huge</i> a <i>real</i> fly would look to one of
the dollies!” she said to herself as she thoughtfully pondered on the
momentous question.</p>

<p>She scarcely liked to ask John if he would undertake such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
particular job, he had done so much already. “Pernickety” he was
sure to call it. So, after much mature deliberation, she concluded to
drop the matter for the present, at least.</p>

<p>“What is the use of screening up the back and sides when the
front is all open anyway?” Bob had exclaimed when Sally finally
broached the subject to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we are imagining the front is just like that in any
other house!” retorted Sally with some spirit.</p>

<p>“Well, then imagine that the flies can’t come in,” responded
Bob. And that settled it.</p>

<p>Odd as it may seem, the attic was the very first room that Sally
started to put in order. And a most delicious little place it was,
with its raftered ceiling and neatly plastered walls. With the vision
of their own immaculate attic in her mind’s eye, the child proceeded
to neatly range around the walls several doll’s trunks, a tiny spinning
wheel and two or three odd wooden chairs; also one of the
many cradles that had been presented as offerings at the shrine of the
doll’s house. A spinning wheel and a cradle comprised, for the most
part, what Sally denominated a “proper” attic.</p>

<p>From the rafters the child hung tiny bunches of good-smelling
herbs, for which cook had been levied upon. To be sure, no such
thing existed in city attics as a rule, but they did down at the farm.
Sally suddenly recollected that they also had spiders and cobwebs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the attic at the farm. The very thought of a spider made her
shiver, but she wondered if it would not be well to affect a few cobwebs,
and privately concluded to request Miss Palmer, her beloved
governess, to paint in a few with water-colors,—a scheme into which
Miss Palmer heartily entered, adding on her own responsibility a
fat, yellow spider, whose appearance was so realistic that Sally
shrieked when she first discovered it. Bob promptly suggested that
a few rats should be added. But rats, Miss Palmer declared, were
beyond her powers of creation. They would require to be real,
solid little beasts, and not simply painted flat on the wall. To this
Bob readily assented, gravely adding that if they were only painted
on the wall, of course they never could come down at night to bite
the dolls. Bob concluded his remarks by making a grimace so fearfully
suggestive of a prowling rat that Sally fled in anguish, and
Miss Palmer, while she could not refrain from smiling, felt forced
to request that he would cease from tormenting his sister.</p>

<p>From the attic to the kitchen is quite a long jump, at least it
would have been without the staircase. But the kitchen was the next
on the program, and thither were the forces of the furnishing party
now directed. Never had a new kitchen been so liberally supplied
with stoves, kettles, pans and pots, especially <i>stoves</i>. It really
seemed as if everyone who had not sent a cradle had sent a stove.
Every kind except an electric one, as Sally sadly reflected. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Miss Palmer consoled her by saying that she doubted very much if
electric stoves came in so small a size. So Sally was presently very
well content to see a most fascinating little cast-iron affair set up,
on top of which was ranged an array of pots and kettles sufficient to
prepare a dinner for the most particular of dolls, albeit of diminutive
size.</p>

<p>Opposite the stove stood a neat dresser, filled with a most wonderful
array of china and glass. To be sure, Sally had reserved the
very best for the china closet in the dining-room, but the display in
the kitchen was a goodly one. So also was the wooden and tinware
that hung upon hooks and displayed itself on shelves all around the
walls. But the article dearest to Sally’s heart, and over which the
child lingered longest in a perfect passion of delight was a miniature
refrigerator, an almost exact reproduction of the big one downstairs.
Lined with opal glass, its well-filled shelves were weighted down
with all sorts of delectable edibles that dolls are presumed to delight
in. Its upper compartment was filled with chunks of ground glass
to represent ice. Sally lingered long in rapture over this delightful
bit of furniture, and having at last located it entirely to her satisfaction,
placed over against it a cute little three-cornered closet containing
a collection of brooms and mops, and a wee carpet sweeper,
whose tiny, revolving brushes really picked up any small bits of
fluff and lint that happened to be about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely never was a kitchen so perfectly and generously supplied
with all things needful, from the shining yellow oil-cloth on the
floor to the beautiful blue table and chairs, the gift of nurse, who
declared them to be exactly like those used in the “auld counthry.”
The whole shining region was presided over by a stiff, colored cook
in turban and apron, who, alas! could never sit down on the beautiful
blue chairs, as she belonged to the variety of dolls that does not
bend in the middle.</p>

<p>Out of the kitchen opened the laundry, which was furnished
quite as perfectly in its way, with a ravishing little laundry set which
Mamma Wee had discovered in one of the big department stores.
Everything was most complete and the whole family lingered in admiration
over the shiny copper boiler that adorned the neat stove, the
glittering flatirons and very tiny clothes-pins. The arrangement
for heating the irons, a black, pointed kind of stove against the sides
of which the irons stood up flatly, filled everybody with ecstasy.
Sarah, the laundress, begged for a loan of it, declaring that she had
never seen anything that could compare with it for heating real
irons.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/illus018.jpg" width="372" height="470" alt="Girl showing dollhouse to maid" />
</div>

<p>This joking pleased Sally immensely, and she invited Sarah to
use the laundry for the family washing whenever she felt so inclined.
Whereupon Sarah departed laughing and declaring that
she had “never seen anything to come up to it, before nor since.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“Before nor since” was a favorite expression of Sarah’s, the meaning
of which neither Sally nor indeed anybody else had ever been able
to fathom. “Forevermore” was another expression
over which the little girl pondered deeply.
She was afraid to ask for information, lest she
should give offense, for Mamma Wee
had carefully
trained her little
daughter to be
especially considerate
of the feelings
of all who
were dependents
in the household.
Therefore Sally
wondered in secret,
and the mystery
was never
solved, as far as I
know, to the end of the
chapter.</p>

<p>The dining-room came next in the natural sequence of things,
and an extremely imposing and spacious room it was, with floor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
paneling polished to represent hard wood, while above the panels
was displayed a gorgeous paper of a lively red pattern. The ceiling
was raftered and studded with tiny electric light bulbs. A fine bow
window occupied one whole end. In truth, ’twas a love of a room
and no mistake.</p>

<p>A lofty china closet contained all the fine glass and china, while
a sideboard of newest pattern groaned under its weight of rich German
silver. Everything was of the most novel and up-to-date pattern.
The round table, the finely carved chairs, and the beautiful
Persian rug that Grandma had knitted from ravelings of carpet,
worked in with heavy crochet cotton, all went to make up a picture
not easily to be rivaled in the annals of doll’s houses.</p>

<p>The bow window was a delight in itself. All around it ran a
wide seat which Sally piled high with tiny silk cushions, while crisp
muslin curtains finished with wee ruffles shaded the panes. A couple
of canaries hung aloft in their gilded cages. The whole effect was
stunning, and the assembled family silently gloated over it and
unitedly envied the dolls who were to enjoy such an ideal dining-room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE TEDDY BEARS TAKE A HAND</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-t.jpg" width="90" height="82" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Teddy Bears, as one may well suppose, were no less
interested in the furnishing and arrangement of the
doll’s house than the members of the family themselves.
They had scarcely been able to sleep a wink for thinking
and talking over the subject in hand, and Peter Pan himself had
proudly brought gifts, not exactly gold, frankincense and myrrh,
but something much more acceptable in the shape of a wee mail-box,
the very counterpart of those that hang upon the telephone posts.
It had been captured during one of his predatory night raids, during
which he and Bedelia had ransacked a neighboring toy store,
carrying off the mail-box as Peter Pan’s share of the loot, while
Bedelia joyfully abstracted a most delightful little workstand that
could be shut up like a camp chair and stood against the wall if so
desired, with a gorgeous yellow silk lining.</p>

<p>In justice to the bears, it must be said of them that they did not,
in this case, break through and steal, for Peter Pan left upon the
counter a piece of money, shaken down from his own little bank—a
most beautiful bank in the shape of a mottled, earthenware pig,
which Sally had presented to him without the smallest idea in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
world that he would ever use it for legitimate purposes. But the
very fact of ownership turned the Teddy Bear at once into an inveterate
miser, and he hoarded like a magpie, levying on every pocketbook
that his mischievous paws fell upon. He was, however, too
cute to appropriate any but small coins, so that thus far nothing had
been missed. Teddy Bears can scarcely be supposed to have any
adequate idea of values, so when Peter Pan proudly deposited a
nickel on the counter, he considered that he was paying very well
for the articles chosen by himself and his wife. The piece of money
was afterwards found by the shopkeeper, and as he never missed
the small articles that had taken the fancy of the Teddy Bears, he
considered himself a nickel in, and “As a man thinketh, so is he.”</p>

<p>To extract the bit of money from the bowels of the pig had been
a fearful piece of work, and had it not been for the end in view, the
Teddy Bear would have given up in despair. To drop a nickel into
the little slot in the creature’s back, and then to listen to the delicious
rattling it made in the cavernous interior was one thing, but
to fish it out through that narrow aperture was quite another. Anyone
who has ever tried the experiment will appreciate the dreadful
quarter of an hour that ensued as the Teddy Bears, perspiring in
every pore, struggled with that most niggardly of china pigs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/illus022.jpg" width="331" height="509" alt="Girl on bed looking at three bears" />
</div>

<p>First they essayed to fish out the coin, using successively a hair-pin
bent out straight and one end fashioned into a hook, a buttonhook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a pair of manicure scissors, ruining the curved points, a
crochet needle, and nurse’s best hat-pin. Nothing, however, availed.
The pig, like his predecessor in the story that would not jump over
the stile, would not give up the coveted
coin. Finally Bedelia seized it
by its head and shook it frantically,
literally as the oft quoted
terrier shakes the rat. But no
nickel! To be sure, they could
have smashed the pig, but in
spite of his obstinacy he
was the Teddy Bear’s
chief treasure, and
Peter Pan loved his
mottled exterior and
gloried in his impossible
snout and extremely
unpiglike ears. He could
not bring himself to sacrifice
a thing so cherished,
even on the altar of his
love for Sally.</p>

<p>After a while the bears desisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from their efforts and held a council of war. Peter Pan had about
come to the end of his tether when suddenly his eyes, roaming miserably
about in search of some new weapon of offense, fell upon
something that caused him to utter a little shriek of delight. And
the article was nothing more nor less than a stick of chewing gum.
Now the Teddy Bear knew all about gum. He had tried to chew
some once and had been obliged to beg help from Sally, so closely
were his jaws welded together. She had laughingly pried them
open, and had advised him not to bite off more than he could chew
in the future.</p>

<p>Peter Pan did not intend to bite off anything in this case. He
put one end of the gum in his mouth and chewed on it till his jaws
ached, and then passed it on to Bedelia, who repeated the performance.
And in two shakes of a lamb’s tail the end of the stick of
gum was reduced to a mass of stickiness that rivaled fly-paper.
Peter Pan now turned the bank, that is, the pig on its back so that
the coins within it came rattling down over the opening. He next
carefully inserted the chewed end of the gum, using the unchewed
portion as a handle by which to propel it into the aperture, and presently
drew it triumphantly forth with two dimes and a nickel sticking
to the mass. Great were the rejoicings at the success of the trick,
and Peter Pan, supposing that the nickel was much the more valuable
as it was greater in size than the dimes, laid it aside while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he returned the other coins to the bank. Afterward he explained
the whole performance to Sally, who was very glad indeed to hear
it, for at first she had been somewhat doubtful as to the origin of
her delightful mail-box.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the furnishing and arranging went merrily on, and
Sally sighed in delighted rapture as she contemplated the work of
her hands and found that it was very good.</p>

<p>Her drawing-room she thought was her especial delight, all
done in red velvet, with a splendid red carpet and lace curtains at
the windows, over which hung draperies of red silk. A tall pier
glass stood between the windows, and on the mantel-shelf were a gilt
clock under a glass case, and two gilt candlesticks holding real wax
candles. Underneath, in the grate, a glowing flame of crimson tinfoil
shone comfortably, tinfoil being the fuel universally accepted
for grates in doll houses.</p>

<p>A fine center table, marble-topped, occupied the middle of the
room. The chairs were luxurious, and Sally only wished that her
size were compatible with nestling down on one of them.</p>

<p>Across the hall from the drawing-room was the music-room, all
furnished in blue upholstered satin, and containing two pianos, a
grand and an upright. Potted plants of the paper variety bloomed
in the windows and a wee violin in a polished case lay atop of the
music cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally had destined this apartment to be a living-room and music-room
in one, and finally added a porch swing that hung in a frame
and teetered delightfully when a doll sat in it; a couple of parrots
in a gilt cage; and Bedelia’s workstand. The effect was somewhat
incongruous, especially in connection with blue satin chairs and
sofas, while Bob remarked, quite gratuitously, that when once the
parrots got started nobody could ever hear either the violin or pianos.
However, as Sally was the only one to be pleased, no one took any
notice of this remark.</p>

<p>With regret Sally turned from the bright little music-room, but
was presently just as deeply engrossed with the library. Here was
a peach of a room, to use her own expression—a room all furnished
and upholstered in green, with sleepy hollow chairs and a roll-top
desk in one corner. Around the walls ran shelves filled with tiny
books, and a wee telephone hung in one angle of the wall, near the
desk. At one end of the room was a big fireplace, over which rose a
high mantel-shelf, and a grandfather’s clock ticked, metaphorically
speaking, in the corner.</p>

<p>Sally had desired that her library should be “restful” and to
that end had worked out the scheme of furnishings on a somewhat
subdued scale. However, she succeeded admirably in carrying out
her design, an end which few grown-ups ever attain. Never was
there a more charming haven of rest to which a doll might fly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
refuge from the turmoil without than this dim, shadowy room, with
its deep lounging chairs and bewitching tea-table drawn up at one
side of the fire.</p>

<p>There was a tiny smoker’s set, too, ranged on an oriental looking
tabouret, a collection of tiny brass articles that would have delighted
the soul of any lover of the weed. Want of space had compelled
Sally to unite library and den, but the union of the two made
a much more charming room than either one could ever have hoped
to attain to by itself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="320" height="454" alt="Boy working at worktable" />
</div>
<p>Bob had contributed to the library a distracting pipe rack,
fashioned from the bits of a cigarbox and cunningly cut out with his
jig-saw, an article whose usefulness promised to be unlimited as
far as a doll’s house was concerned. The rack was hung with tiny
pipes picked up at one of the ten-cent stores at ten cents per dozen.
Bob was proud of his handiwork and Sally considered it one of her
chief treasures because Bob had made it.</p>

<p>On the third floor were the bed-rooms and bath-room. The
bed-rooms, fascinatingly furnished with dainty patterns of cretonne,
with fine brass beds, and ruffled curtains at the windows, were places
of rest and delight. One of them was arranged for a nursery and
contained two cunning little white enameled cribs. There was also,
in this room, a most intricate folding bed for the nurse.</p>


<p>The bath-room was most elaborately appointed with shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and needle baths, as well as a fine, white enameled tub and a complicated
system of plumbing. By means of this real water ran from a
tank over the tub and furnished
forth a liberal supply for the
ablutions of all the dollies.
To be sure, one was obliged
to be very careful not to allow
the tub to run over, for an
overflow meant ruin and rout
to ceilings below stairs.</p>

<p>Teddy Bears have no
sense of ratio and no
amount of explanation
could ever convince Bedelia
that she was of a
size entirely out of proportion
for the Walking House. Finally
she made one valiant effort to
establish herself therein, but was
driven to retire, growling, as she could
not force more than her big head and shoulders into any of the
ordinary-sized rooms. There would not have been room even for
Little Breeches, let alone for Bedelia’s generous proportions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>BEDELIA GROWS A TAIL</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-b.jpg" width="82" height="80" alt="B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">BEDELIA was an extremely handsome bear, as Teddy
Bears go, but for some time she had been plunged in
inexpressible gloom because she possessed no tail. In
vain her family expostulated with her, pointing out the
fact that a bear with a tail would indeed be a freak and a monstrosity.
Bedelia persisted in her notion, unreasonable as it was, and very
nearly succeeded in driving Peter Pan to the verge of insanity. For
although she led him a merry dance as a rule, he was extremely fond
of her, and being of a chivalrous nature, made all sorts of excuses
for her queer notions. Therefore he had very nearly arrived at his
wits’ end when Bedelia suddenly ceased her lamentations and became
quite cheerful—a change which, had Peter Pan only read her
aright, would have appeared ominous. However, the poor fellow
was so delighted at seeing his wife once more like her former self
that he suspected nothing, not even when Bedelia began to absent
herself at intervals from the family circle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/illus029.jpg" width="319" height="407" alt="Bear and dog" />
</div>

<p>Truth to tell, Bedelia had a great deal more sense than most
humans and realized after a little that scolding and fretting would
never attain the end in view. She wanted a tail, and a tail she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
meant to have, and immediately began to cast around in her fertile
mind as to the means that she should use to accomplish her end.
She was far too cute to ask advice from those who had so discouraged
her, but waited with trembling anxiety for
the inevitable something which is sure
to turn up sooner or later. It is a
long lane, indeed, that has no
turning, but the further one
progresses, the nearer it is to the
end; and Bedelia helped along
the somewhat tedious waiting
by a series of experiments that
would have filled the
breast of the gloomiest
with hysterical mirth.</p>

<p>The beautiful, feathery
appendage of Rough
House had at first attracted
her attention as he held it
aloft and waved it plume-like in the air. But somehow Rough
House had been very rude and had nipped her smartly when she
laid hold and began a series of heroic tugs. And she had retreated
in disorder with a rip in her coat, made by the dog’s gleaming teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Afterward she reflected that the tail was far too large and would
not have matched her own fur anyway. This thought brought consolation
and she proceeded to turn her attention and her energies
in other directions. But try as she might, she could find nothing
in the line of a tail that became her. She tried them all from
every animal in the nursery, and nurse, finding them one by one
lying on the floor, had shaken her head as she attached them successively
to their original owners. She had her own ideas on the
subject and they chiefly included rats, or perhaps little Rags who
was getting his second teeth and might incline toward chewing things
up. Sally alone suspected Bedelia, but was unable to catch her at
her evil-doing, as she carried on her marauding chiefly in the silent
night.</p>

<p>Having weighed in the balance and found wanting all the ready-made
tails she could find, she looked about for something out of which
to manufacture the right thing. Nothing, however, presented itself,
and Bedelia realized that she could scarcely have formed so important
an article with her own clumsy paws, even if it had. So
for the time her occupation seemed gone, and she began to mope
again, filled with chagrin that all her efforts should thus be foiled.</p>

<p>Meantime the summer waned and crisp nights began to suggest
fall weather. One bright afternoon Bedelia had been sitting curled
up on the broad window-seat on which she and her family kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
house, pouting as usual and longing for something in the shape of
mischief with which to occupy her rapacious paws. Sally and nurse
were busy making doll clothes, as several occupants of the Walking
House were still without suitable outfits. Suddenly nurse exclaimed,</p>

<p>“I believe it is soon going to be time for furs. Do you mind,
darlin’, the nice set your aunt, Miss Edith, gave me Christmas, with
all thim little tails on the muff?”</p>

<p>Tails! Bedelia’s ears were pricked up in a moment. Tails,
and fur tails, too! Well she remembered the day in early spring
when all the furs of the household had been aired and beaten and
hung out in the sun before being laid away in boxes, liberally
sprinkled with camphor and finally the covers all pasted up with
strips of paper. They had been put away in the big store-room at
the top of the house, and Bedelia knew exactly where they were.
But she knew, also, that the store-room was always kept locked and
she did not feel very sure where the key was kept.</p>

<p>She determined, however, to lose no time in looking for the
bunch, and although it took nearly a week of investigation, they were
found at last, and Bedelia lugged them off and hid them in a place
whereof she knew, and which already contained a motley array of
articles which at one time or other her fancy had prompted her to
filch.</p>

<p>Several more days elapsed before a suitable opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
visit the store-room occurred. But at last Bedelia found herself
standing in front of it with the bunch of keys in her eager paws.
Behind the locked door lay the darling wish of her heart, a tail,
and in a moment she had, as if by magic, selected the right key and
swung open the heavy door.</p>

<p>Now a new difficulty confronted her, one of which she had not
even dreamed. There were at least a dozen boxes standing on the
shelves, all neatly labelled, of course. But Bedelia could not read,
and no good fairy appeared to tell her which box contained nurse’s
furs and the particular tail. So she stood gloomily gazing into the
closet and at last concluded that much as she hated to take the trouble,
there was but one thing to do and that was to open every box
until she discovered the right one. This she at once set at work to
do, tearing and ripping with a pair of scissors that she had brought
along, emptying out furs and camphor in a promiscuous heap, dumping
the contents of one box on top of another until the erstwhile
orderly store-room presented the appearance of a rummage sale.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="362" height="462" alt="bear climbing along shelf" />
</div>

<p>Now, had Sally been conducting the investigation, she would
have known that the sets of furs were kept in the smaller boxes, while
fur robes and so on were pinned in big bundles. But Bedelia, of
course, never stopped to think of that so it fell out that nearly everything
else in the closet was ripped open and flung out on the floor before
she came across the box in which the coveted furs reposed. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
were very respectable furs of a shade of brown that seemed to Bedelia
just the proper one to harmonize with her own skin. And there
were tails in plenty, more tails than Bedelia’s wildest dreams had
ever conjured. She felt
that she could wallow
in tails now if she
chose, and it did
not take her long
to get possession of
what she wanted.
She nipped off half
a dozen, taking
them from the
neckpiece to
which they were
attached by little,
pointed heads, each
one with its ferocious
mouth wide
open displaying a number
of tiny, white teeth.</p>

<p>Gathering up her treasures, she hurried downstairs, having
taken care to lock the door and replace the key where it had originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hung. Then holding fast to the bunch of stolen fur, she hurriedly
sought a quiet corner in the attic, whither she often fled when
for any reason she wanted to be by herself.</p>

<p>A big, old mirror in a tarnished frame stood on the floor and
after something of a struggle, for the thing was heavy, Bedelia arranged
it so that she could see herself to full advantage.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="335" height="452" alt="bear holding tail up to self looking in mirror" />
</div>
<p>Everybody knows that Teddy Bears have great facilities for
looking over their shoulders. In fact, when built as a Teddy Bear
should be, they can turn their heads all the way around. Consequently
Bedelia found no difficulty in getting a full view of herself
in the rear as she stood with her back to the glass, the tail in one paw
and a couple of pins in the other. She had decided to leave the little
head as it made an admirable finish for the tail, and really gave a
very jaunty appearance to the whole. So she concluded after having
clapped the whole into place and fastened it firmly with two
large shawl pins. So delighted was she with the result that she stood
before the mirror for a long time, craning her neck and twisting
her head around while she admired her new ornament. To be sure,
the head was in a place where no head ought to be, but it grinned
jubilantly while the tail flopped joyfully as its owner walked.
Finally, like Narcissus, satiated with the view of her own loveliness,
she concluded to descend to the lower regions and show off the latest
addition to her charms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Down the stairs she trotted, trying to get used to the rather
queer sensation of the tail flapping against her hind legs. Luckily
she met nobody till she reached
the nursery. Here her courage
suddenly deserted her
and she made a wild
break for the window-seat,
in the corner of
which she at once threw
herself and was making
believe to be fast
asleep when a most unforeseen
event occurred.
The head, which
we have already recorded
as being in a
place where no head
should be, objected to the
full weight of Bedelia’s plump
body upon it, and proceeded to nip her so
vigorously that she sprang up, shrieking.</p>

<p>Peter Pan, who had at first thought that to let her alone was
perhaps the better policy, now flew to the rescue, but when he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the cause of the trouble, he rolled on the floor in convulsions
of laughter. The head kept on nipping for pure viciousness, and
poor Bedelia, half crazed with pain and mortification, raised a
dreadful wail that brought all the members of her family to the
rescue. Quite willing to be relieved of the source of her discomfort,
she melted completely under her husband’s affectionate caresses, and
finally acknowledged that Teddy Bears really had no pressing need
of caudal appendages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MARY AND HER LITTLE LAMB AND SOME OTHERS</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-a.jpg" width="81" height="79" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">AMONG her most treasured dollies was one that Sally’s
Auntie Edith had dressed as Mary to be accompanied
by her little lamb, the latter to be purchased from some
toy store when Mary’s wardrobe was completed.</p>

<p>Now, the Walking House had been built on generous lines so
that the rooms were more airy and the dolls, in consequence, larger
than those that inhabit most doll’s houses. Mary, then, was a blond
beauty, with the fluffiest of yellow locks, crowned by the most bewitching
of shepherdess’ hats, and the most delightful costume of
pale pink and white, perfect in every detail from the fluffy paniers
of the overdress to the long, slim crook which Bob had carved with
his jig-saw and which Mary, unfortunately, could not carry owing
to the fact that her china fingers, like those of most dollies, were
straight and inflexible. A bit of very fine wire, neatly manipulated,
however, produced the desired effect, and indeed Mary felt very
little doubt in her own mind as to the fact that all the rest of the
dolls were cunningly deceived by it.</p>

<p>So much for Mary. When it came to the lamb, that was quite
another thing, for it seemed impossible to find anywhere a lamb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the correct proportions to fit in with those of the charming little
Mary. Store after store was ransacked in vain, when suddenly Sally
recollected that somewhere in the attic reposed the remains of a
Noah’s Ark which she had grown tired of and had put away some
time before. To the attic, then, they flew and presently unearthed
the Noah’s Ark carefully tied up in brown paper and still in a very
fair state of preservation. Out upon the floor pell-mell they emptied
the animals, but no bleating or baahing lambkin rewarded their
quest. It seemed as if there had been a general demand for mutton
and that everything of the sheep variety had been swept from off the
face of the earth. Thoroughly disappointed, Auntie Edith sat dropping
the animals back into the Ark when suddenly she stopped with
a little scream of delight and snapped up a small object that had
fallen on the floor and been hidden under her skirt.</p>

<p>Not a lamb, however, as Sally at first supposed, but a goat that
might have passed anywhere for a sheep except for its horns. It is
very odd what a striking resemblance often exists between the animals
of a Noah’s Ark when really there is no relationship between them
at all. So it was with this goat. The little curls of wool with which
he was covered, his legs and hoofs, his long, meek face, everything
except the sharp, curved horns resembled most intimately Mary’s
little lamb. And it took about five minutes to transform him into
that very animal. Off came his horns, as quick as a wink their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stumps were covered with bits of cotton wool neatly glued in place.
A blue ribbon was tied around his neck and finished with a graceful
bow, and, lo and behold, the Lamb!</p>

<p>To say that Mary was hugely delighted at this outcome is to
put it very mildly indeed. For she had been greatly troubled in
mind, fearing that after all she would not be Mary but somebody
else that did not require the continued attendance of a lamb. Somebody
else, or perhaps nobody in particular! At this mournful conclusion
a tear rolled silently down Mary’s china cheek. But now it
was all right, and she stood up right bravely on her little, high-heeled
shoes, grasping her crook with one hand, while the other
rested proudly on the Lamb’s woolly back. A very delightful picture
she made, and a very welcome addition to the family of the
Walking House she proved to be. But of Mary and her Little
Lamb we are destined to hear more hereafter.</p>

<p>Sally was very fond of arranging and re-arranging her doll’s
house, and on one particular morning was busily at work, this time
at the kitchen that already shone with cleanliness. Sally was squatting
on her heels, cleaning out the ice-box, which contained many
plates holding delicious looking foods of all descriptions. To be
sure, they were only make-believe, but they certainly looked good to
Sally, who had not eaten much breakfast and consequently felt hungry.
One in particular appealed to her fancy, a delicious looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
cake, frosted and ornamented as if for a birthday. Really all it
needed was an array of glittering candles to make it perfectly realistic.</p>

<p>Sally mechanically broke off a bit of the frosting and put it
between her lips. To her astonishment, it tasted crisp and sweet,
with rather a flavor of pineapple, and altogether like the real thing.
She broke off another scrap and swallowed it. Another bit and
another followed the first and then suddenly Sally began to experience
a very queer sensation. She felt as if she were being screwed
down and shrinking together like a pair of opera glasses. So quickly
did the whole thing happen that before she knew it, she was standing
in the kitchen of the Walking House with the black, wooden
Dinah gravely regarding her.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh dear! What would have happened if I had
eaten the whole cake? And it’s a wonder I didn’t, it was such a
little one!” exclaimed Sally.</p>

<p>Just then she happened to look up, and beheld Peter Pan and
Bedelia regarding her with terrified glances. A great wave of loneliness
swept over the child and she burst into tears. In a moment
Peter Pan and Bedelia had each seized a fragment of cake and in
less time than it takes me to tell it were rapidly following Sally’s
example. In about two minutes they were enjoying the distinction
of being the smallest Teddy Bears on record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Into the kitchen they scrambled after Sally, much to the bewilderment
of black Dinah, who had never anywhere seen such creatures
as Teddy Bears of that size, and was not at all sure that she
liked them, especially when they walked into the house and took
possession of her kitchen.</p>

<p>The first few days of Sally’s sojourn in the doll’s house were
full of events and also full of interest, and the little girl experienced
all the new sensations that always come with a change of scene and
place. Sally’s intimate and somewhat unique experience of nursery
life had really taught her nothing relating to existence in the doll’s
house, and the mode of living employed by the little people to whose
number she now apparently belonged.</p>

<p>She was, indeed, very much surprised to discover that in all
respects they resembled very closely the human species, with all
their little fads and fancies, jealousies and ambitions; and it was
both amusing and astonishing to encounter among the dolls that
she herself had bought for a few cents and dressed with her own
hands in scraps obtained from the rag-bag, personalities as striking
and characteristic, as distinguishing as those belonging to some of
the famous people whose lives she had studied with Miss Palmer
during her history lessons. At least so one would think from their
own opinions of themselves.</p>

<p>The little girl was amazed to learn that all the dolls could read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and write and that those who were imported spoke French and German
fluently. In fact, one small Japanese doll who was rigged
out in a paper kimono and wide obi of the same material, jabbered
away in Japanese, with the result that none of the others could
understand a word she said. She always presided at afternoon tea,
however, which function they understood very well, as also the tiny
cups of the fragrant drink which she brewed for their benefit. Sally
secretly resolved to teach her English, which she later accomplished,
much to the gratitude of the lonely little foreigner.</p>

<p>The dolls’ handwriting was not at all like her own, as it did not
take Sally long to discover. It consisted of a number of queer little
hieroglyphics of infinitesimal size, which, as Sally afterward
learned, were known only to dolls and were so small, to wit, that
nobody would ever imagine that they were anything but foolish
scrawling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE LITTLE BACK DOOR</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-s.jpg" width="78" height="80" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">SALLY was busily bustling around the kitchen, clad in
one of Dinah’s clean gingham aprons and with a stiff
and clean bandanna ’kerchief perched on her shining
hair. For Dinah was ill, the result of an unfortunate
accident, for which the little girl felt herself more or less responsible.</p>

<p>For some time the Little Lamb had been growing “grimy,
grimier and grimier,” as Sally said to herself, and the child had
finally resolved, although not without some misgivings, that a bath
would be the next best thing in the order of events. Having several
old scores to settle, Mary joyfully offered to assist, and with such a
backing Sally proceeded with her preparations in a resolute and
hopeful frame of mind.</p>

<p>As the Little Lamb was indeed very dirty, Sally prepared a kind
of shampoo, such as she had often seen nurse concoct for her own
use. This was composed of tar soap, melted over the fire to a kind
of jelly, and then beaten up with a couple of eggs and a dash of
borax. When it was finished, it made a yellow, frothy compound,
altogether nice and delectable looking. Sally had made a liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
quantity, owing to the area that had to be covered in the personality
of the Little Lamb. She left it on the kitchen table, and hurried
off to find that worthy who, scenting an impending conflict, had betaken
himself to the attic. Entrenched behind Bedelia’s screen, he
firmly awaited the onslaught of the enemy.</p>

<p>Dinah had all this time been busy in the upper part of the
house and now returning below stairs beheld the foamy, creamy
mixture frothing over the pan on the kitchen table. It never entered
into her wooden head to suppose that it was anything except
some nice omelet or something of the kind that one of the dolls or
perhaps Sally had knocked together for luncheon. Stirring it up
with a spoon, she found it rather thin, and proceeded to thicken it
with flour and finally decided that it would serve best as batter for
griddle cakes. As she herself was extremely fond of lemon flavoring,
she added a large dose of that, and then proceeded to bake the
mess on the well-greased and sputtering griddle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illus045.jpg" width="345" height="458" alt="Dinah and Bedelia eatting cakes" />
</div>

<p>Now it must be confessed that Dinah was greedy, and the brown
cakes certainly looked tempting. Besides, had she not planned
something quite different for the dolls’ luncheon? Just one nibble
she took, and then, like other people who have hesitated, she proceeded
to get lost. Her wooden palate certainly failed to detect
the flavor of tar soap, and one brown and smoking cake speedily
disappeared after another. Goodness knows when she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
stopped had not Bedelia, attracted by the odor of the baking cakes,
suddenly appeared in the kitchen.</p>



<p>That worthy had been decidedly
out of favor with Sally
for several days, and
consequently was in no
enviable frame of
mind. Without so
much as a “by your
leave,” she now advanced
on the greedy
Dinah, snatched the
plate of cakes from
under her very nose,
and proceeded to dispose
of them with
neatness and despatch.
Her taste for eatables
had been well cultivated,
however, and she
now discovered something decidedly peculiar in the flavor of the
cakes. But she swallowed them all to the last crumb, more in order
to spite Dinah than because she wanted them, pausing now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
between bites to utter a threatening little growl that served very effectually
to keep Dinah at a distance, for the cook was dreadfully
afraid of the Teddy Bears. It did not
take very long for the soap and borax to
get in some very fine work, and soon Dinah
and Bedelia found themselves companions
in misery.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus046.jpg" width="350" height="459" alt="Bedelia getting a lecture on gluttony" />
</div>

<p>When Sally had
hunted all over the
house without being
able to find the Little
Lamb—and no
wonder, for he was
safely entrenched
under Bedelia’s bed
in the attic—and
came hurrying into
the kitchen to look
after her shampoo, she found two unutterably
wretched individuals tied up
in knots and rolling around on the kitchen
floor. Had it been Bedelia alone, Sally would have suspected a
trick, but Dinah’s sufferings were too genuine to admit of suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally flew for help without waiting for explanations, and in a
short time the sufferers were tucked up in their beds, feeling decidedly
more comfortable and listening to a lecture on gluttony
which they did not soon forget. Not but that this same lecture had
to be administered in two sections, one to Dinah in her room and
one to Bedelia in the attic, for Dinah would have died sooner than
lie down in the same room with the Teddy Bear that she now regarded
with more fear and dislike than ever.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Sally was flying around the shining little
kitchen, putting things to rights and making ready to get together
something for the dolls’ luncheon. She smiled as she scoured and
dried the tin pan in which the shampoo, whose ending had been so
unusual, had been mixed. She wondered what had become of the
Little Lamb, and could not help wishing that he, instead of Dinah
and Bedelia, had been the one to gobble up the sickening cakes, for
the stuff certainly had been intended for him in the beginning.</p>

<p>Sally was a born housekeeper, and as she had formerly played
with her doll house, perpetually cleaning and straightening it, so
she now worked in the bright little rooms until at last all was in
order, the table laid for luncheon and a savory meal made ready.
She was too much delighted with her work to ask for assistance
from any of the dolls, and puttered around briskly, singing little
snatches of a song half under her breath. “Puttering around” was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
one of Dinah’s pet expressions, and while Sally had never been sure
what it really meant, she felt quite certain that she could not be
doing anything else while working in Dinah’s kitchen. Vigorously,
then, did she flutter Dinah’s duster, seeking for dust where none
existed, and merrily polishing the already shining window sills, on
which stood stiff little pots of glowing scarlet paper geraniums.
And then she suddenly became aware that she was standing in front
of a little door, whose existence she had heretofore failed to observe.</p>

<p>The door was directly in the center of the back wall, and Sally
could not but wonder that John should have built it in such a place,
for the doll’s house stood flat against the nursery wall, as any orderly
doll’s house always stands. Hence there was absolutely no use for
a door in such a location. Sally meditated for a moment or two
and then suddenly concluded that the best thing to do would be to
open the door and do a little investigating. She seized the knob
and pulled vigorously, but to no purpose. The door was locked
sure enough, and her best efforts resulted in nothing. It seemed
very odd that the door should be locked and no key anywhere about.
Suddenly she remembered that hanging up in her room was a tiny
golden key belonging to a chain bracelet that Papa Doctor had once
locked upon Mamma Wee’s pretty white wrist. For some inexplicable
reason Mamma Wee had never unlocked the bracelet, but
Papa Doctor always wore the key on one end of his watch chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
until one day the slender golden ring from which it hung broke,
and Sally had found the key lying on the floor. Papa Doctor had
been called out of town for an important consultation just then, and
had not yet returned. Therefore the key was hanging up in Sally’s
room, and thither the little girl hastened. Having possessed herself
of the article in question, she hurried back to the kitchen, all on tip-toe
with curiosity.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/illus050.jpg" width="291" height="459" alt="Sally leaving room" />
</div>
<p>She did not hear the padding of velvet paws behind her, nor
see the furry brown figure that came trotting stealthily in her wake.
Having taken a good nap, Bedelia awoke feeling as good as new.
After a few preliminary yawns, she bounced out of bed, much to
the detriment of the Little Lamb who, too much scared by all the
rumpus to run away, had finally fallen asleep under the bed with his
head sticking out at the inner side where he had considered it quite
safe, as the bed stood comparatively close to the wall. But with
her usual perversity, Bedelia jumped out of that side of the bed,
landing plump in the Little Lamb’s face. Bedelia was no light
weight, and the unhappy Little Lamb uttered a piercing shriek, at
the same time hastily wriggling back into his place of concealment.
Bedelia had been considerably shaken by her sickness and now,
scared out of all her impudence by the queer thing that she felt
moving under her feet, she uttered a shrill squawk and fled precipitately
from the attic. She paused at the top of the stairs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
peered down between the railings just in time to see Sally emerge
from her room with the key in her hand.</p>



<p>In a moment the Teddy Bear was on the
alert, trotting silently down the
stairs, dreadfully tempted to
take a slide down the polished
rail of the banister, but
equally afraid of being sent
back if discovered. In the
meantime, Sally hastened to
the kitchen, clutching the
golden key which was, of
course, very much larger in
proportion than in the time
when she had found it lying
on the nursery floor.</p>

<p>“How I do hope it will
open the door!” the little girl
said to herself as she thrust it into the
lock and pressed against it very gently,
for she was rather afraid of breaking off the golden handle. To
her surprise and delight, however, it yielded at once, and with a
turn of the door knob Sally flung open the door and stepped outside,
closely followed by the still unseen Bedelia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>D. TABLET, ESQ.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-i.jpg" width="82" height="81" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IT was surprising enough to find that there was any outside,
for Sally had fully expected to step down between
the doll’s house and the wall. But to find herself on a
beautiful country road, flanked on either side by fields
of emerald green that stretched away as far as the eye could reach,
was far more astonishing still.</p>

<p>On either side of this road stood a row of tall, very stiff, very
green trees. They literally <i>stood</i>, for they did not grow out of the
ground, but rose out of flat, wooden stands that did not appear more
wooden, however, than their shiny, brown trunks. Green and stiff
also were the leaves that looked more like curled and painted shavings
than anything else. Sally examined them curiously, remembering
she had once possessed a toy farm that had contained just
such trees as these. She laid her hand against the smooth, glistening
trunk, wondering if a brisk breeze would not upset the whole
business, and remembering how easily her own farmyard trees had
been overturned. These, however, seemed steady enough, and Sally
started off at a good pace, determined to investigate the queer
country into which she had made so unceremonious an entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as she could see, the road stretched ahead of her, glaring
white in the noon sunlight, which seemed almost blinding after the
subdued light of the doll’s house. Only a moment did she pause to
hang the precious golden key upon the string of gold beads that she
wore around her neck. Somehow she felt that that dear talisman,
the pledge of love between her parents, would be to her a safeguard
in time of danger. A sudden fear of losing it assailed her, and she
quickly tucked beads and all inside her dress.</p>

<p>Turning for a farewell look at the Walking House, she beheld
Bedelia sitting demurely on the doorstep. The door she had closed
behind her as she stepped out. Now she jumped up and ran to
Sally, who was very much relieved to find the little bear was quite
herself again, and slipped her hand affectionately inside Bedelia’s
arm. And the two proceeded joyously along the gleaming road.</p>

<p>It was quite warm, for the stiff up-and-down foliage cast little
or no shadow, and there was no breeze stirring. Sally was grateful
for this as she still felt rather doubtful concerning the stability of
the trees. Bedelia, however, expressed it as her opinion that even
if one of them did blow over, she and Sally would be well able to
stand it up again. But then Bedelia had always been very self-confident.</p>

<p>The two companions trotted along together, stopping occasionally
to examine some queer flower or a tree that looked a little different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
from the common run. Sally noticed that the flowers were
all like those that ornamented the windows of Dinah’s kitchen—of
crimped and fluted paper, while the little blades of grass appeared
to be fashioned from the same
material. The
whole thing seemed
as if it might prove
very monotonous,
at least if it were
going to exist for
good and all.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/illus053.jpg" width="364" height="403" alt="Sally and Bedelia walking" />
</div>

<p>Presently they
came to a fine,
large field that
was fenced in all
around, and Sally
could not but notice
that the fences were
all wonderfully like those that
had belonged to her own farmyard. In the field were grazing a
number of beautiful, placid looking cows and also a good many
sheep and goats. They were all wonderfully familiar in appearance.
Sally could not understand, although she did later on, why everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
she had seen so far suggested either the Noah’s Ark or the
farmyard. Both of them had long since been relegated to the dust-bin,
defaced and broken beyond any kind of usefulness.</p>

<p>And then Sally spied not very far ahead of them a sign post,
which, when they came up to it, exclaimed in a most affable manner,
“Five miles to the Palace!” and gently waved one of its arms toward
the cross road, on the edge of which it stood.</p>

<p>Sally was so much amazed at hearing a sign post speak that
for the moment she failed to notice the absence of any painted directions
upon its arms. However, Bedelia, who was as usual ready
for anything, retorted somewhat pertly, “And where might the road
that we are traveling on lead to?”</p>

<p>To which the Sign Post responded with the same cordial,
although somewhat wooden tone and a most reassuring smile, “Five
miles to the Palace,” whereupon it subsided and stood quite stiff
and straight, as if, perchance, waiting for another question, to which
Sally felt quite certain it would have responded, “Five miles to the
Palace!”</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by asking questions that
would obviously receive only the one answer, with a word of thanks
the children proceeded on their journey, wishing it were not quite
so far to the Palace, for they were both beginning to feel tired and
as she had taken no luncheon, Sally was decidedly hungry. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
she looked back and saw that the Sign Post was gazing after them,
still wearing its affable smile. And the child fancied that she could
hear a faint murmur, “Five miles to the Palace,” while she was
quite certain that the Sign Post waved its
arms in a friendly adieu.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="342" height="459" alt="looking at sign post" />
</div>

<p>Sally now noticed for the first
time that Bedelia was carrying a
large paper bag which
bulged out to such an
extent that it seemed
every moment as if it
would burst. That it
was weighty was
vouched for by the fact
that Bedelia frequently
shifted it from one paw
to the other. Truth to
tell, the Teddy Bear,
ever mindful of the inner
man, had made a swift raid on
the kitchen as she passed out of
the house, and had swept into the paper bag every eatable that
she could quickly lay her paws on. Sally was just on the eve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
asking what the bag contained when suddenly its bottom gave way
and there issued forth a perfect rain of fruit, sandwiches and cakes,
besides a bottle of milk and a jar of pickles. Since the mystery had
seen fit to unravel itself, Sally was only too glad to commend Bedelia’s
forethought. Having gathered up the scattered feast, the
two sat gratefully down under the shadiest tree they could find and
proceeded to feed in a most luxurious manner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Bedelia, her hunger overcame any remote
idea she might have possessed concerning good manners, and she
proceeded to gobble in so outrageous a fashion that Sally was about
to remonstrate when suddenly the culprit was arrested by the sound
of a small, querulous voice that seemed to come from her innermost
being, and which exclaimed in jerky tones,</p>

<p>“Don’t shovel things down so fast, for goodness’ sake! How
do you expect me to get any work done properly when you work me
so fast? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I shall never have anything in
order!”</p>

<p>Bedelia distinctly felt a queer sensation as if something were
hopping up and down at the very center of her little, round stomach.
To say that she was terrified is putting it very mildly, while Sally
was too astonished to move, even though she had by this time become
used to queer happenings.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink any more milk,” continued the voice in a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
exasperated squeak. “Everything down here is in a flood. I can
hear your food splash as it drops in. There isn’t a dry place for the
sole of my foot.”</p>

<p>Although she was scared, Bedelia resolved to preserve a bold
front, and now replied with assumed calmness, “Whoever you are,
come out here and let us see what you are like.” And then she
added saucily, “You needn’t think you can prevent me from eating
what I want!”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say? What’s that you say?” squeaked the
voice, as if its owner were in a terrible rage. And the very next
moment Bedelia felt a dreadfully choking sensation, and out of her
mouth popped the queerest little figure that Sally had ever laid
eyes upon.</p>

<p>He was not more than half an inch tall and he was pink all
over, even his eyes and his hair and his long, flowing beard—bright
pink like Bedelia’s tongue. And there he stood, glaring at Bedelia
as well as he could, for the bright sunshine made him blink dreadfully,
and at the same time he bowed politely to Sally, whom he
evidently regarded with approval. And Sally bowed gravely in
return, although she could hardly keep from laughing outright at
the queer little creature with his round, flat body, his thin, crooked
arms and spindling legs, and above all his extremely pompous manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“In me you behold Tablet—D. Tablet,” he remarked without
further preliminaries.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/illus058.jpg" width="331" height="464" alt="Sitting by the side of the road talking to D. Tablet" />
</div>

<p>He paused a moment, and Sally exclaimed
impetuously, “I have heard of dyspep—”
Here she stopped abruptly, afraid she
had already given offense. “Dyspepsia
tablet” she had been
going to say.</p>

<p>But much to her
relief, the little creature
nodded affably
and quickly continued,
“Children like you,
who eat in moderation
and show some breeding
while they eat, have no
need of my good offices.
Only creatures who stuff like
pigs have to be reproved by me.”</p>

<p>There was a slight pause and D. Tablet
presently continued, evidently flattered by the attention of his audience,
although he still glared at Bedelia out of his pink eyes which
had now become accustomed to the sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Know, then,” he went on, “that your stomach and everybody’s
stomach is simply a storehouse in which the food is put away on
shelves in pantries and cupboards as fast as it is swallowed. Everybody
who comes into this country has a D. Tablet in his stomach to
attend to this business. He may not know it, but we are there all the
same. Therefore when you pile in fifty different things at once and
drown it all with oceans of liquid, how can we possibly get things in
any kind of order? We don’t, and then you are ill, as <i>you</i> were yesterday.”</p>

<p>Bedelia jumped, so suddenly did D. Tablet wheel around upon
her.</p>

<p>“And then when you don’t chew your food, what do you think
happens? A few moments ago you were gobbling exactly like a
p-i-g. Do you know what that spells?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, independent gentleman! And I don’t care a snap
what happens,” impudently retorted Bedelia.</p>

<p>By this time she had decided that D. Tablet was a great bore,
and being still hungry, was itching to get at her neglected luncheon.</p>

<p>At this D. Tablet turned pinker than ever with rage. His flat
little body seemed to swell up until it was nearly as round as a
marble. For a moment he stood shaking with anger, and then
without another word suddenly vanished, but whither they were not
able to see. Whether or no he had plunged down Bedelia’s throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and once more assumed the endless task of setting her internal
economy to rights, neither Sally nor the Teddy Bear had time to
observe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE TALKING SIGN POST</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-d.jpg" width="77" height="77" alt="D" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“DON’T you think it was telling awful whoppers?” asked
Bedelia, as she settled down comfortably upon her
haunches and proceeded to dispose of a plump red
banana with a rapidity that would certainly have called
forth a rebuke from the personage to whom she referred.</p>

<p>Sally hesitated, not quite certain which side it devolved upon
her to defend. She certainly had been somewhat impressed by D.
Tablet. Had she not seen him come tumbling, frog-like, out of Bedelia’s
throat? For aught that she could prove to the contrary, he
had, perhaps, gone tumbling back again. Being thus cruelly torn
between her fondness for Bedelia and her sense of justice, she wisely
held her peace, while Bedelia, by this time well on the way with the
second banana, mentally hurled defiance at her pink advisor.</p>

<p>“He was damp all over. He looked as if somebody had <i>licked</i>
him!” she finally ejaculated, throwing away her banana skin and
standing up preparatory to suggesting that they resume their
journey.</p>

<p>At the same moment her face stiffened, while her eyes fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bulged out of her head with amazement. Hurrying straight down
the road toward them, and advancing by leaps and bounds was a
long, lithe figure that they both recognized as it came nearer as the
Talking Sign Post. It now came up at a brisk gallop, and exclaimed
breathlessly as soon as within hailing distance,</p>

<p>“I was <i>so</i> afraid you would get lost without me!”</p>

<p>Thereupon it threw itself comfortably down on the greensward
and beamed amiably at Sally. She felt very much like replying
that if he had been a little more communicative in the beginning, the
danger of going astray would have been smaller. However, she
refrained, being dreadfully afraid of offending the Sign Post, who
after all appeared to be very good-hearted. Not so Bedelia, who
cocked her sharp, little, black eyes in a most inquisitive manner and
hastily retorted,</p>

<p>“No thanks to <i>you</i> if we <i>did</i> get lost, with your ‘Five miles to
the Palace’ and nothing else. How should we know which turning
to take next?” And then she added hurriedly, “Why don’t you have
things painted on you as they do in civilized countries?”</p>

<p>“If by <i>things</i> you mean directions,” replied the Sign Post
gravely, “it would be altogether superfluous in a land where everything
can talk. And as for turnings,” he added severely, “there
aren’t any. All the roads in Toyland lead to the Palace, so you are
sure to get there some time or other. To be sure, some roads are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
longer than others. In the event of your taking the longest one, you
might consider yourselves lost.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/illus063.jpg" width="357" height="458" alt="Sitting at side of road with Sign Post" />
</div>

<p>All out of patience with what she considered
an extremely round-about explanation,
Bedelia did not trouble herself to
reply, but Sally
hastened to smooth
things over by offering
the Sign Post some
luncheon out of the
paper bag, which
they had managed
to repair with
some pins, and
which now contained
the remnants of their
repast. This, however,
he politely refused, having
already lunched copiously
on his usual diet of shavings which curious
regimen agreed best with his wooden constitution. Sally was
rather disappointed at this. She recollected once having been taken
to the Zoo and having seen the ostriches fed with oranges. And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
remembered how very queer it had appeared to her to watch the
fruit as each piece traveled down the birds’ long, red throats, one
chasing another until they finally vanished in the feathery region
below. She could not help thinking that the Sign Post was very like
the throat of an ostrich, only the resemblance continued all the way
down. She could not but wonder where the luncheon would finally
have located itself, as there were apparently no facilities for expansion
in the general make-up of the Sign Post.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which Bedelia made ostentatious
preparations for moving on.</p>

<p>Fond as she was of the little bear, at that moment it seemed
to Sally that it could not exist in any sort of comfort without making
somebody else miserable. So she said very gently,</p>

<p>“Would you kindly tell me what land we are in?”</p>

<p>She felt quite sure that the Sign Post was waiting for her to
open the conversation.</p>

<p>An expression of surprise flitted over the mobile countenance
of the Sign Post, but he replied without further comment, “This is
the wonderful country of Toyland,” and then murmured in a reminiscent
manner, “Five miles to the Palace. Five miles to the Palace.”
After a moment he added, “Perhaps it will be just as well
for us to be moving without more delay. It is quite a long way for
you to walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>So all three got upon their feet and cheerfully resumed their
travels.</p>

<p>The country, although very fresh and green, seemed to the little
girl rather monotonous. The same cows, pigs and sheep, the same
stiff little wooden houses, fenced in by the same stiff wooden railings.
People seemed few, but as it was not far from noon, Sally concluded
that they must all be eating their dinners. And a very sensible conclusion
it was. The few folk that were encountered were of the
wooden doll type, and they all appeared to be so very busy at their
work in the fields that Sally forbore to hail them, although she would
dearly have liked to stop long enough to pass the time of day with
them.</p>

<p>So the three proceeded, chatting merrily, the Sign Post accommodating
his long, swinging stride to the shorter steps of his small
companions. An exchange of confidences was, of course, the natural
thing, and Sally was soon giving a complete account of herself and
Bedelia and of how they had happened to stumble into Toyland.
The Sign Post listened with attention, and in return gave much
valuable information concerning both himself and the country. He
explained that there were many other Sign Posts like himself, that
they were stationed at intervals of five miles, and that it was their
duty to conduct as well as to direct strangers, should they so desire.
He also explained that there was no night in Toyland, as it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
very difficult and expensive business to start up the sun, which in
consequence was allowed to go on shining <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>“Whenever anyone feels in need of rest or <i>repairs</i>, he takes a
trip to Sleepy Town. It lies just over there and adjoining our own
country. There it is always night, the moon shines perpetually, and
everything invites slumber.”</p>

<p>Here the Sign Post yawned in so fearful a manner that Sally,
gazing on his open countenance, decided that he might very well be
a candidate for Sleepy Town.</p>

<p>Following the direction in which he had pointed as he described
the location of Sleepy Town, Sally’s glance discerned what
appeared to be a faint, purplish haze hanging upon the horizon.</p>

<p>“You will find a great many Sign Posts there,” said her companion
so abruptly that Sally jumped, for she had fancied that he
was still yawning, “on account of the darkness. For example, how
would a stranger find Nid-Nod Street or Blanket Avenue, were
there not someone present to inform him?”</p>

<p>And Sally, comprehending the weight of his argument, nodded
gravely.</p>

<p>The trio had now accomplished half their journey, and about
two miles and a half lay between them and the Palace. Sally did not
feel particularly tired, as the road was very smooth and not at all
dusty. Once an automobile passed them and Sally noted the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that it was of exactly the same pattern as one that she owned and
which now reposed in the nursery at home in a garage constructed
by Bob of building blocks. It was of the wrought-iron variety, and
was wound up with a key.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/illus068.jpg" width="273" height="370" alt="being carried by Sign Post" />
</div>
<p>The auto which had spun merrily by suddenly stopped a few
yards ahead of them and refused to budge an inch. Sally and her
companions hastened their steps and, coming up with the auto, found
that it had run down. As the chauffeur had forgotten to bring along
the key, the party of lady dolls that occupied the car were plunged
in the deepest despair and chagrin. Sally suddenly remembered
her little golden key and hastily produced it. It was found to fit
to perfection. With many thanks the party proceeded on its way,
first having invited Sally and Bedelia to take seats in the car. The
Sign Post was, of course, quite out of the question. However, Sally
politely declined, as she really preferred very much to continue her
walk with her lanky companion, to say nothing of Bedelia. This
the Sign Post greatly appreciated, and presently stooped down and,
gently lifting the little girl, he poised her aloft on his shoulders, and
in this gallant fashion she rode for a mile or more, while Bedelia
trotted behind, grumbling and growling at the discourtesy shown
her. Although she had been very uncivil indeed to the Sign Post,
Bedelia could see no good reason why she should not ride on his
other shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>



<p>Being completely rested—indeed, she had not been a bit tired
in the beginning—Sally slid laughingly to the ground, quite in
opposition to the wishes of the Sign Post, who would gladly have
carried her till the end of the chapter.
They had ascended a slight hill, and
the city now lay in plain sight in
the charming valley beneath
them. Sally could not but observe
that there was nothing at
all imposing in its appearance.
All the houses seemed planned
after about the same pattern.
Even the Palace itself seemed
to be only a doll’s house on a
larger scale than the others.
Sally’s mental comparison of it
with her own beloved Walking
House was anything but favorable. The
little girl presently paused, however, to reflect that being now in
the country of dolls and toys, she could scarcely expect to find
sky-scrapers. Bedelia turned up her nose frankly enough, and, as
was her custom, at once proceeded to express her opinions without
let or hindrance. And what might have been the result had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
been permitted to conclude as she began nobody knows, for the
Sign Post was beginning to look very much put out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/illus069.jpg" width="368" height="456" alt="Watching doll house walk down road" />
</div>

<p>But just at that moment their attention was attracted by a loud
noise behind them, a fearful pounding and bumping. Looking
around, they beheld advancing along the road at a high rate of speed
a huge <i>something</i>—what
they were
at first unable to
decide. But as it
came nearer and
nearer and finally
swung into full view,
they discovered that
it was nothing more
nor less than the
Walking House, hurrying along at
an astonishing pace, while from
the interior issued a doleful voice
which loudly repeated at intervals
the entreaty, “Wait for me! Wait
for me!”</p>



<p>All its windows glistened in
the sun like blinking eyes, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
castors on which it originally stood had somehow turned into
prancing feet that now hopped and skipped along with the greatest
alacrity. On it came, bumping and bouncing, and all its terrified
inhabitants bumped and bounced too, while they hung on for dear
life to any available piece of furniture that they had happened to
grasp. And nearly scared out of their wits was every mother’s son
of them, for only a colony of rubber dolls could have been in a comfortable
frame of mind under such trying circumstances. Greatly
relieved were all when the frisky house suddenly ceased its gyrations
and came to a dead stop directly in front of Sally.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>JOYTOWN</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-i.jpg" width="82" height="81" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IT was clearly a case of a runaway house, and before
Sally had time to finish wondering how on earth it
could have walked out of its own back door in order to
step into Toyland, as she and Bedelia had been obliged
to do, she was surrounded by all the inmates of the Walking
House, who came scrambling down the stairs and out of the
doors, thoroughly glad that their rough-and-tumble ride had come
to an end.</p>

<p>Everybody crowded around Sally, and all sorts of experiences
were exchanged. Finally the Sign Post reminded the little girl that
it was growing late and if they wished to enter the city under his
escort, it would be well to make a move, as he had already been a
long time away from his post of duty. Accordingly the whole party
set out, and soon descended the slight hill from which Sally had
taken her first look at the city. After they were all safely at the
bottom, the doll’s house proceeded down very cautiously and <i>backwards</i>.
For it was dreadfully afraid of spilling all its contents if it
went down in its normal position. At length it was safely landed at
the bottom, but Sally immediately discovered that it never would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
able to get into the city as the gates were not particularly wide, and
certainly had never been set up with a view to admitting strange
houses that came galloping along, unceremoniously clamoring for
entrance. Therefore after a brief consultation, it was decided that
the house should remain outside the gates, which were never closed, as
there was no night there; and that the family should make it their
headquarters and return for rest and refreshment whenever they
became tired out with exploring the new country. This matter
having been arranged, Sally and the faithful Sign Post proceeded to
lead the way into the city.</p>

<p>Over the gates was inscribed the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
THE CITY OF JOY<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">neatly painted in plain characters distinct enough for all to read.
And with this most propitious name to greet them, the inhabitants
of the Walking House advanced bravely up the principal street.
Everything appeared to be extremely peaceful. People—who, of
course, were all dolls and very much like their visitors in size and
appearance—were going about the streets and in and out of the
shops and offices.</p>

<p>Sally rather wondered at the absence of policemen, but upon
remarking on this to the Sign Post, quickly found herself obliged to
explain what she meant. The word was unknown in Toyland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
such a word as crime had never entered its vocabulary. The Sign
Posts were the nearest approach to anything in the nature of “the
force,” and they were only for
general guidance
and information.
The little girl
marveled greatly
at such a state of
affairs, and hoped
most devoutly that
Bedelia would behave
herself while
sojourning among
such peaceful
folk. That
worthy, trotting
along with her paw
clasped in Sally’s
hand, looked the very
picture of innocence.
Sally had seen her look like this before, and at such seasons usually
prepared for the worst.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="364" height="462" alt="Sign post leading group " />
</div>

<p>The main street upon which they now were walking led straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the Palace, which towered aloft above the other houses in the very
center of the city. Upon closer acquaintance, Sally quite altered
her previous opinion and found the building a very fine one indeed,
even in comparison with the Walking House. She could not help
wondering if it also possessed feet in embryo that might develop and
run away with it at any unexpected moment. She was rather afraid
that the dwellings in Joytown, having noted the example of the
Walking House, might perchance take a notion to follow the same.
There was, however, nothing whatever to cause apprehension in the
dignified attitude of the staid and stationary dwellings of the chief
city of Toyland. Sally felt that all quite depended upon their
powers of observation, and whether or not they had noticed the
antics of the Walking House. For is not example more effective
than precept? Sally feared that it might be so. However, she had
no time for reflection, as all the party were anxious to make a tour
of the city, and the dinner hour was rapidly approaching. It was
too late to visit the Palace, so after a walk, during which they covered
a good deal of territory, they retired to their own dwelling.</p>

<p>The soft, golden twilight which took the place of night, now
commenced to fall, and Sally observed many parties of the residents
leaving the city and starting in the direction of Sleepy Town. The
Sign Post, who, at Sally’s earnest solicitation, had obtained permission
from headquarters to remain with the child and her party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
during their stay in Toyland, now informed Sally that the twilight
was brought about by draping the sun with many veils of delicately
tinted gauze.</p>

<p>“You see there really is no necessity for it at all, except that
having the day all the time becomes rather monotonous,” he went
on. “And besides that, there would be no sense in having such a
long day. One could not continue at work for more than six hours,
the time laid down by the trade unions.”</p>

<p>This seemed a remarkably short day to Sally, and she now inquired
what the Sign Post meant by veiling the sun. But that
worthy immediately assumed an air of mystery and replied,</p>

<p>“It was entirely the idea of the Polly-nosed Saphead. You
must ask of him, for he alone understands the nature of the occult
rite.”</p>

<p>“And who, pray, may be the Polly-nosed Saphead?” demanded
Bedelia, who was hopping along on the other side of the Sign Post,
very demure and highly interested in all that was taking place.</p>

<p>At this the Sign Post shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>“He is the high priest of all Toyland,” he replied. “Few are
permitted to enter his august presence.”</p>

<p>He shook his head again, and was silent. And Sally and Bedelia
both solemnly shook their heads, and were silent also for the
space of at least a full minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>However, there did not appear to be any use in standing still
and shaking their little craniums over the Polly-nosed Saphead.
Accordingly Sally and Bedelia cordially thanked the Sign Post, who
promised to join them early the next morning, and made their way
toward the Walking House. They would gladly have invited their
companion to enter, had he not been entirely too tall for any of the
rooms, or even to get in at the door. As the Sign Post was very well
used to standing out-of-doors, he patiently took up his stand close to
the house, there to await the coming of the morning. To be sure, it
seemed very queer to him not to be saying “Five miles to the
Palace,” he had been saying it for such a very long time. In fact,
he had never before in all his existence been called upon to quit his
post, as he was a comparatively new Sign Post. But a very pleasant
business he found it, especially when acting as escort to such a delightful
little girl as Sally.</p>

<p>Meantime Sally and Bedelia had entered the house, where they
found the rest of the family awaiting them. After a short consultation,
it was decided to observe the general rules that had governed
them before they had arrived in Toyland. Because other people
never went to bed was really no reason why they should not if they
found it necessary. Therefore the shades were drawn down, the
lights extinguished, and the whole household soon wrapped in refreshing
slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Sally wakened and, peeping out between the curtains—for
the window was close to her bedside—beheld the long and lanky
form of the Sign Post standing patiently at his place. His countenance
still bore its affable smile and the child fancied she could hear
him murmuring, “Five miles to the Palace. Five miles to the
Palace.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/illus078.jpg" width="463" height="593" alt="Sally in front of Colonel" />
<div class="caption">Sally felt a great longing to tip over the gorgeous little Colonel.</div>
</div>

<p>“Only it couldn’t be five miles, because it isn’t any miles at all,”
murmured the child, as she slipped away into dreamland. “He’s
right at the very door of the Palace.”</p>

<p>Sally slept late, and as soon as she awoke sprang out of bed and
rushed eagerly to the window. There was the Sign Post, nodding
and smiling at her, and waving good-morning, to which she responded
in like manner, and then made haste to dress and ran down
to the kitchen, where she found Dinah busily preparing breakfast.
All the dolls had been up all night, putting the house to rights, as it
had suffered a terrible shaking up during its journey, and there was
not a piece of furniture in the whole place that had not bumped and
bounced and slidden, so that it all presented a very much tumbled-up
appearance when at last the house came to a standstill. However,
the dolls had worked busily, and by the time Sally descended
everything was in fine shape.</p>

<p>After a toothsome breakfast, a short council was held as to the
best methods of procedure. It was decided to go forth in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a><br /><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
small parties, as their number would make one single group rather
too large. The Sign Post had managed to take part in the conference
by stooping down and poking his head in at the window, and
now hastened off to summon others of his kind. Presently returning
with them, they all set off on their explorations.</p>

<p>Sally and Bedelia, with their faithful guide, formed a party by
themselves and very gaily they set forth, though it must be confessed
that Bedelia looked a bit solemn. Having eaten a huge breakfast,
she was beginning to experience certain sensations which caused her
to apprehend that D. Tablet, Esq., might once again be on the rampage.
These disagreeable feelings, however, gradually wore away,
and the little bear was presently padding along as merrily as any of
the others.</p>

<p>Beautiful indeed was the Imperial City, with its bustling business
section and its lovely residence portion, its symmetrical parks
and gleaming lakes. And high above all, as if keeping guard over
the peaceful city, the lofty Palace, which stood on a slight eminence
and was therefore rendered extremely prominent by its position as
well as its size and distinctive style of architecture.</p>

<p>Sally did not know very much about architecture. Most of her
knowledge on the subject was included in the somewhat mixed-up
style of the Walking House. Neither she nor Miss Palmer had
ever been able to decide whether it was Grecian or Roman, ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
or modern. To be sure, Miss Palmer had been anxious to spare
John’s feelings on the subject, and therefore had been slow in offering
an opinion. And Sally was now plunged in quite the same perplexity
with regard to the Palace. She could not help wondering if
it had been designed by the Polly-nosed Saphead, who, since he appeared
to be such a great personage, might well be a great architect
also.</p>

<p>The Palace stood in the midst of a beautiful park, filled with
the usual types of trees that Sally had noticed as peculiar to Toyland,
and was approached by a lofty flight of steps, guarded on
either side by a whole regiment of lead soldiers, “The Royal
Guards,” as the Sign Post explained in a rather awe-struck manner.
Sally felt a great longing to tip over the gorgeous little Colonel, as
she had often done with her lead soldiers at home, and send the
whole rank and file toppling over, one upon another. But she suddenly
recollected that she was now not the least bit bigger than the
soldiers themselves. And so she meekly followed the private who
was detailed to conduct them to the presence of Royalty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>SALLY AND BEDELIA ARE PRESENTED AT COURT</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-p.jpg" width="69" height="72" alt="P" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">PRECEDED by their guide, Sally and Bedelia passed
between the great doors of the Palace and into a mighty
circular hall that was lighted from above by a huge
dome of golden colored glass, which cast a soft and sunshiny
radiance over everything. In the center of the hall rose a
wide and winding spiral staircase, heavily carpeted with deep yellow
velvet, whose bordering melted away into soft browns and russets.
Sally thought she had never seen anything more lovely than
the color scheme of this imperial hall, with its rich woodwork of
carved golden oak, and the golden light flooding everything.</p>

<p>Twelve great doors opened out of the hall and they were now
ushered with great ceremony through the one directly facing the
wide entrance and were received by a splendidly dressed court page,
while the private promptly saluted and went about his business.</p>

<p>When Sally, with heart thumping in a most uncomfortable
manner, ventured to lift her eyes from the pavement of tessellated
marble, she beheld a most magnificently appointed apartment of
regal size, thronged with courtiers and ladies-in-waiting, all in
splendid court dress; while at the further end rose a gorgeous throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
upon which were seated two of the handsomest dolls she had ever
seen. She suddenly felt herself very plain and insignificant in the
midst of all this splendor.</p>

<p>But there was no time for personal criticism, for she was being
rapidly conducted up the hall by the gorgeous page, who was at the
same time loudly announcing her name and that of her companion.
The child felt herself blushing to the roots of her hair as she dropped
her prettiest curtsy, and dreadfully aware in the midst of her
embarrassment that Bedelia was attracting attention from all directions.
In fact, that personage possessed most strikingly original
ideas of court etiquette and, having made a most extraordinary bow,
proceeded to lick the hand of royalty which had been most graciously
extended to be kissed. This performance gave birth to a
ripple of laughter, which at once broke the ice. The courtiers
crowded around Sally and Bedelia, while the King and Queen descended
from their throne and proceeded to make themselves most
agreeable to the strangers.</p>

<p>The Queen was a most beautiful blond, with large, blue eyes—Sally
noticed that they had real, black lashes—and a bewildering
wealth of golden curls, which she wore floating over her shoulders
and whose luster put to shame her golden crown. She wore a splendid
gown of white satin, embroidered with threads of gold, over
which opened a robe of purple velvet lined with ermine. A splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
court train swept far behind her, and she was, furthermore,
adorned with all the family rhinestones, which made a prodigious
sparkling and glittering and appeared very magnificent indeed.</p>

<p>The King was a very tall and finely-built doll, with very dark
hair and eyes. His dress was of royal purple velvet, slashed with
white satin. He, also, wore a crown of fine gold and a splendid
signet ring set with a large ruby, upon which Bedelia gazed with
suspicious interest. Noticing her interested expression and following
the direction of her glances, Sally began inwardly to quake, and
resolved that the mischievous little bear should be separated as far
from the King as possible. An unkind fate, however, willed it
otherwise, for the Queen, who felt rather afraid of Bedelia,
promptly linked her arm in Sally’s and the two walked slowly down
the long hall, leaving the King to follow with the little bear. Truth
to tell, Her Majesty was extremely curious with regard to this new
kind of doll, which was neither made of china nor stuffed with sawdust,
and she pressed Sally’s hand and patted her arm, consumed
with curiosity, although disliking to ask of what material she could
possibly be made.</p>

<p>Sally was destined to have her ideas concerning royalty turned
topsy-turvy. Indeed, all her previous notions, obtained from well
authenticated books, pictured kings and queens as quite the reverse
of what she was really finding them. The idea of a king promenading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
arm in arm with a Teddy Bear, or with any kind of a bear, as
far as that went! She could not help smiling to herself to think
how angry Bedelia would be could she know of what she herself was
thinking. For Bedelia had always considered herself a most important
little personage, and quite good enough society for kings and
queens, too.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were chasing each other through Sally’s
brain, the Queen was interestedly, if furtively examining the little
girl’s dress and her beautiful, lustrous braids which reached below
her waist. Much was her secret astonishment to discover that the
latter were not glued on, as were her own golden tresses. This she
could not fail to consider a serious detriment, for she was the proud
possessor of numerous wigs, and simply exchanged one for another
as soon as it became mussed up, a proceeding which she considered
vastly superior to having the tiresome combing and curling done
with one’s own head for a foundation, which must be the case with
Sally, of course.</p>

<p>In fact, the Queen was rapidly coming to the conclusion that
Sally was a most delightful problem and one very worth while solving.
To this end she informed the pages that no one else would be
given audience, and insisted that Sally and Bedelia should spend the
rest of the day at the Palace.</p>

<p>In the meantime Bedelia had been amusing the King, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
found himself highly entertained by this entirely new species of toy
animal. He had never before beheld anything like her, although
very well acquainted with every specimen in his kingdom. Toyland
was destitute of Teddy Bears, a fact that greatly astonished Bedelia,
who did not know whether to be mad or glad on account of
it, and concerning which she later on demanded an explanation of
the Sign Post. However, he declared with a solemn shake of his
head that a question of such momentous import must needs be referred
to the Polly-nosed Saphead, a personage concerning whom
Bedelia was already burning with curiosity.</p>

<p>However, the King declared Bedelia to be very good company
for the time being. And, though Sally was shaking in her shoes
for fear of what she might next consider it proper to do, she behaved
herself in such a bright and comical manner that His Majesty declared
he would immediately find out why none of her species had
ever before penetrated into Toyland.</p>

<p>Bedelia privately decided that she would herself find out before
he did, or know the reason why. However, she intimated nothing
of the kind, and as the Queen just then suggested that they make a
tour of the Palace and grounds, the subject was dismissed for the
time at least.</p>

<p>The Queen now threw her long train over her arm and settling
her golden crown a little more firmly on her golden curls, she caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Sally’s hand and the two moved towards the door, followed by the
King and Bedelia. The latter had, as a matter of course, taken the
King’s arm, and now marched along with her nose in the air, greatly
to the astonishment of the scandalized court ladies, very few of
whom had enjoyed a like honor. His Royal Highness was too
much amused and diverted to feel any embarrassment. Truth to
tell, life in Toyland had been dull of late, the same thing happening
every day without change or variation, and the King was beginning
to be horribly bored. Bedelia had dropped from the sky, as it
seemed, in the very nick of time.</p>

<p>The quartet proceeded through the crowd of respectfully bowing
courtiers to the big doors at the lower end of the room and passed
through them into the outer hall. The royal automobile was in
waiting, and after a general tour of the Palace the party stepped
into it and started for a ride through the charming country.</p>

<p>As they reached the edge of the town, they beheld the Walking
House patiently awaiting developments and, both King and Queen
desiring to look it over, the party descended at once and proceeded
to examine it. The position of guide was, of course, snapped up
by Bedelia, whose fluency of speech fitted her very well for such
work.</p>

<p>The King inspected everything with the greatest interest, noting
many improvements unknown in Toyland, Both King and Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
insisted on being introduced to all the dolls, and made themselves
most delightfully agreeable.</p>

<p>The little bear now noticed for the first time the absence of Peter
Pan, a fact which she had hitherto passed by, owing no doubt to the
very good time she was enjoying. Squatting on her haunches in
the kitchen while she devoured a big, red apple—for she considered
that the claims of the inner man preceded even those of royalty—she
revolved the matter in her mind, finally coming to the conclusion
that there could be but one reason for Peter’s absence: that after
their disappearance from the doll’s house, he had discovered some
means of returning to his original size, and had availed himself of
it, probably finding the society of the doll’s house uncongenial minus
Sally and Bedelia, and preferring that of his cubs. Bedelia devoutly
hoped that he had preserved a portion of the “restorer,” as she
mentally styled it, for herself and Sally. Greatly as she was enjoying
herself, she certainly had no intention of remaining as she
was for the term of her natural life. Playing at being dolls was all
very well for a season, but was scarcely satisfying enough for a perpetual
diet. Besides, there was her family. She wondered how
Tom and Jerry and Little Breeches were getting along without her.
It was something of a consolation to feel that Peter Pan was with
them in her absence.</p>

<p>Bedelia’s brain worked quickly, if it was made of silk ravelings!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
And she had firmly settled the whole matter in her own mind long
before she had finished the red apple.</p>

<p>When she had taken the last bite and had carefully extracted
the seeds, of which, squirrel-like, she was extremely fond, she dropped
the core into the coal scuttle, wiped her paws and muzzle on
Dinah’s best apron which happened to be freshly done up and airing
before the fire, and betook herself upstairs to find out what had
been going on in her absence. As she passed the basement door, she
saw the Little Lamb scurrying out of it, but thought nothing of the
incident and sped upstairs to the drawing-room from which issued
the sounds of lively conversation.</p>

<p>The King and Queen had explored every nook and corner of
the Walking House, and now expressed a most lively desire to see
it walk, a request with which the House stubbornly refused to comply.
Firmly planted upon its pedal extremities, which had to all
intents and purposes turned themselves back into castors again, it
stoutly resisted all coaxing and persuasion; and the project was
finally abandoned, much to the disappointment of their Royal Highnesses
and the chagrin of Sally.</p>

<p>The Queen declared it high time to be on the move, as they had
brought along an elaborate luncheon which was to be served wherever
they felt like stopping, and it was already along toward noon.
Therefore they all climbed into the auto and presently rolled away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
waving good-bye to the dolls, who were assembled in front of the
house to see them go.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/illus090.jpg" width="367" height="488" alt="Everyone in a motor car" />
</div>

<p>A second auto with the servants and
luncheon followed at a convenient
distance. There was no dust to
take for the roads
were all neatly
covered with velvet
carpet whenever
the King
and Queen went
abroad. The automobile
having
been wound up
just before it left the
garage, there was no
fear of its running
down, and even if it
had, Sally felt quite sure
that her golden key would have
been quite sufficient to start it up again.</p>

<p>The child could not but think that the King and Queen looked
exceedingly comical automobiling in their royal robes and jeweled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
crowns. The long train of the Queen was dreadfully in the way,
and was always overflowing the sides of the auto and having to be
re-arranged, while her golden crown wabbled to such an alarming
extent that she was obliged to hold on to it with both hands, a proceeding
which was not at all comfortable. Nor was the King any
better off, but rather worse, for the Queen’s long and carefully
dressed hair admitted of hat-pins and formed a much better receptacle
for a crown than did his own short and curly locks.</p>

<p>However, the little party was a very merry one in spite of wabbly
crowns and inconvenient court-trains. And great was the fun and
laughter as they sped gaily along through the charming country.
Presently they crossed a rustic bridge and turned into a beautiful
strip of woods, and here the Queen declared that their luncheon
should be served. It was, indeed, a lovely location. A silvery
stream rippled by and formed a charming cascade, the water having
been turned on from headquarters for the benefit of the royal party.
A number of birds of brilliant plumage hopped about among the
green branches, most of them warbling sweetly. That they had all
been wound up for the special occasion Sally did not for a moment
doubt, but she was already so well accustomed to this sort of
thing that she did not in the least mind it or consider it queer. As
for Bedelia, she had never noticed the difference.</p>

<p>Just then the servants who had been approaching, bearing the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hamper in which the lunch had been packed, suddenly dropped it
and retreated with every semblance of terror. Sally’s heart sank
into her boots, and she glanced nervously over her shoulders to ascertain
if Bedelia were missing. But the little bear was close behind
and with the rest of the party rushed forward to see what on
earth ailed the royal servants. The hamper lay upon the ground,
while in one side yawned a great hole. And within appeared a
long, solemn face, terminated by a considerable growth of beard.
For Mary did not always find it quite convenient to shave her Little
Lamb as often as was really necessary. The goat’s beard had
sprouted, although the horns had not, and was proving a great nuisance
to everybody concerned.</p>

<p>In a moment the solution of the whole thing burst upon Bedelia.
She remembered having seen the Little Lamb skipping out of the
basement door and surmised that he must have hidden himself in the
automobile until they were all under way and had then chewed a
hole in the side of the hamper, as he could not unfasten the lid, and
finally managed to squeeze himself in by dint of throwing out a
number of articles utterly valueless to goats but considered quite
indispensable to royalty. Of course all this had taken place behind
the backs of the servants, who evidently had never once looked
around.</p>

<p>Poor Sally, who recognized at the first glance the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of the Little Lamb, felt that it would have been a huge relief had
the ground opened and made one mouthful of her. She was too
much scandalized, as well as too honest, to join in the terrified exclamations
of the royal couple, who, however, had but short space in
which to express their emotions. Not seeing any good reason why
he should remain in his rather cramped quarters, which he would
have deserted much sooner had he not feared to jump from the
rapidly moving auto, the Little Lamb suddenly wriggled out
through the hole in the hamper’s side and taking nimbly to his heels,
scampered away and disappeared among the trees, leaving the royal
party to mourn over its departed feast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE POLLY-NOSED SAPHEAD</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-n.jpg" width="78" height="78" alt="N" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">NOBODY ever was awakened in Sleepy Town, but everyone
slept just as long as they chose. Consequently the
morning was well advanced before the King and Queen
awoke, and sat up yawning and stretching in a very
unregal manner. In fact, it was just like the awakening of ordinary
folks. And when they had gotten through with this performance,
they stood up and arranged their robes and put on their crowns
which they had carefully hung up on a nearby poppy bush. Sally
was also awake. She and the Sign Post had already taken a walk
down to the lake where the little girl had looked eagerly for the
Leap-Frog. But the queer little animal was nowhere to be seen,
so the two had retraced their steps, after Sally had bathed her face
and hands in the cool water. They were very glad to find the King
and Queen and Bedelia waiting for them and eager to take the homeward
way.</p>

<p>As they walked towards the gates, Sally noticed quite a number
of Flussies perched on the bushes, their heads under their wings,
fast asleep. The Sign Post remarked that they were the carrier-doves
of Toyland. Here and there a furry bat, hooked on some convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
branch by his little claws, slept peacefully. Sally remarked
how pretty and downy they were, just like little winged mice. She
had always wondered why people feared them, knowing how senseless
and cruel are the superstitions regarding the timid little creatures.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>She repeated the lines half dreamily to herself, wondering if
they included the Little Lamb and others of his ilk, as they walked
along towards the entrance, where they could already see the motor
car, which had just been freshly wound up, waiting for them.</p>

<p>The King and Queen climbed into the back seat, Sally and
Bedelia sprang up with the chauffeur, and with the Sign Post racing
ahead on his long, lath-like legs, they set out at a merry pace for
Joytown.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when they reached the palace, and after
luncheon, the Queen proposed that they should pay a visit to the
Polly-nosed Saphead, the Wizard who really controlled more or less
all the affairs of state. As Sally was only too eager to go, they
hurried away without ceremony as soon as might be, in order to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a good long afternoon. This rather offended all the other members
of the court, who were decidedly inclined to feel aggrieved and
neglected since Sally and Bedelia had come a-visiting to the palace.</p>

<p>The Polly-nosed Saphead lived in a great, round tower about
half a mile from the palace. He had been advised of the advent of
royalty by means of the wireless telegraph, which has always existed
in Toyland. In fact, he claimed to be the inventor of it. But
be that as it may, he received the message from the King all right,
and was on hand to receive the royal party in his big audience
room on the first floor.</p>

<p>When they entered the hall he was discovered sitting in his
big chair of state, his shrunken little body wrapped in a loose robe of
crimson covered with queer black figures and lined with white fur,
while his two pet gargoyles sported about at his feet. Sally saw
with astonishment that he was not a doll, but a real little man, or,
more properly speaking, a little dwarf, with a great head as bald
as a billiard ball. This defect was partially concealed by one little
tuft of hair or scalp lock, which had a dreadful habit of lifting
itself straight up in the air whenever it did not agree with the sentiments
expressed by its wearer. As for the back of his head, it was
as smooth as the palm of your hand, a fact which had long ago
firmly convinced its owner that it was extremely impolite ever to
turn his back on anyone. He had, in consequence, acquired a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for great courtesy, and was pointed out as a kind of Chesterfield
to the rising generation of Toyland.</p>

<p>Great, flapping ears stuck out on either side of the Wizard’s
little weazened face, while his big, bulging eyes were shaded by
brows and lashes that, naturally white, were always carefully dyed
to match the scalp lock, which, if the truth must be told, was dyed
too. After a time the dye gradually wore off and grew lighter in
color, so that when the great man neglected to visit his barber at
proper intervals, his hair, not to mention his lashes, became gradually
of a delicate green hue, having worked successively through
every known shade of brown before it reached this undesirable tint.
When in good condition, it was of a rich and glossy brown, shading
upon black. “Streaky,” Bedelia cruelly declared it, the moment
she laid eyes upon it.</p>

<p>But the most astonishing feature belonging to the Polly-nosed
Saphead was his large, beak-like nose that, shining and fleshless,
rose determinedly from the surrounding level of his countenance
like the bill of a poll-parrot, and imparted to his general appearance
an air of forever wishing to peer into mysteries. Never did
question mark more continuously uprear a perpetual interrogation
than did the great man’s inquiring nasal organ. Hence his name
“The Polly-Nosed” which, far from being a term of ridicule, was
on the contrary, a title of great respect. For were not parrots the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wisest birds in all Toyland? Whatever the rest of the name meant
in the general language of Toyland, we will not now pause to explain.</p>

<p>A real parrot of most brilliant plumage hung upside down on
the back of the wise man’s chair, suspended by its claws and evidently
fast asleep. While the gargoyles that Sally had at once perceived
with great astonishment upon entering the hall, frisked about
their master’s chair.</p>

<p>The little girl had never considered these queer creatures in
any other position than close up under the eaves of a church. And
she had always supposed that their chief occupation was to spout
a great deal of water out of their huge mouths. These specimens,
however, judging from their disorderly conduct, had never heard of
such a place as a church. In fact, they were just then engaged in
trying to swarm up the sides of their master’s chair, in order to pull
down the parrot. That wise old fellow, knowing that in spite of
their clumsy wings, they would never be able to reach him in his
fastness without first wallowing all over their master, slept peacefully
on, upside down as he was, and never paid any attention to them
at all.</p>

<p>They certainly were remarkably hideous looking creatures, having
apparently been left off when not more than half finished, for
they possessed only a head and shoulders, with great front paws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and strong, cruel looking claws. In addition to these, they each
sported a pair of dragon-like wings. They had great mouths that
very nearly met around at the back of their necks, and huge, bulging
eyes, and altogether were anything but pretty pets.</p>

<p>However, they crouched on the floor at a gesture from the
Wizard, who now hurriedly got himself up out of his big chair, and
came forward, bowing and scraping with the most effusive courtesy.
He had big eyes that stuck out dreadfully and gave them a ridiculous
resemblance to the gargoyles, and so fearfully did they wiggle
and roll about that Sally began to fear they would hop out of their
sockets altogether before he had finished his profuse greetings.</p>

<p>He seemed especially glad to see Sally, whom he at once perceived
to be of his own kind, and quite different from the inhabitants
of Toyland.</p>

<p>Everybody having greeted everybody else with much politeness
and warmth, the King announced that he would be greatly pleased
if the Wizard would show Sally the wonders of his tower, especially
the Department of the Sun, in which they were all greatly
interested.</p>

<p>At this the Wizard appeared greatly flattered and begged them
to excuse him for a moment. He hastened to the far end of the
room where the gargoyles had briskly renewed their efforts to get at
the parrot, seized that still soundly sleeping bird, and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to hang him up by his claws on a high bracket that had originally
served to support his own cage. Polly slept serenely and the Wizard,
having tethered the gargoyles to the legs of his great chair, returned
to the waiting party. This greatly displeased the gargoyles
for by this time they had discovered Bedelia, and were quite willing
to lose the parrot if they might get at her. It must be confessed,
Bedelia did not like their looks at all and hung to Sally’s protecting
arm, although she had held up her head and looked back
over her shoulders with a provoking grin as the whole company
left the hall and began to ascend a narrow and winding flight of
stairs that led to the top of the tower.</p>

<p>Up and up they went, finally stepping out upon a wide platform
or veranda that ran all around the tower, and Sally saw that the
great round sun—which she perceived at a glance to be nothing
more nor less than a big electric light within a dazzling globe of
cut-glass—hung directly over the tower. The child understood at
once that the Wizard’s great power lay in his knowledge of electricity.
However, she made no comment, nor even hinted at the
fact that she had ever heard of such a thing.</p>

<p>She was not at all surprised that the Wizard offered very few
explanations. In fact, he was very jealous of his methods of working,
and feared continually that somebody else might discover them.
As there was no patent office in Toyland, the best thing he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
do was to keep his secrets to himself, which he accordingly
did to perfection.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/illus101.jpg" width="292" height="512" alt="on a balcony on a tower with the wizard" />
</div>

<p>The Sign Post, still in faithful attendance,
whispered to Sally that the great surface of the
sun was kept clean by hundreds of tiny elves
who were known as the Sunshine
Fairies and who spent all their lives rubbing
and polishing the glittering
cut-glass surface.</p>



<p>“Once in the beginning,”
he said solemnly, “they grew
weary and fell asleep, and
the face of the sun became
dark and dusty for want of
rubbing, so that we had an
eclipse.”</p>

<p>Sally smiled, thinking it
a great deal more likely that
something in connection with the electric plan
had gotten out of order. However, she offered no comment
but nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“Since then,” continued the Sign Post, “the elves have been
divided into two companies, and at stated times they are sent off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Sleepy Town for rest. Then when they return the others go. It is
a plan that works very well.”</p>

<p>“Much better than having eclipses all the time,” broke in Bedelia
sharply. She was not very sure what an eclipse was, but had
come to the conclusion that it must be something unpleasant and
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Sally now perceived myriads of the little Sunshine Fairies slipping
down the cold and glittering sunbeams, and right jolly creatures
they seemed to be. Each one had two pair of hands and arms
so that when one pair grew tired of rubbing and polishing, the
other might come into play.</p>

<p>Sally was not surprised to find the sunbeams cold, as the moonbeams
in Sleepy Town had been warm and quite springlike in their
temperature. However, she did feel curious concerning the manner
in which they were regulated, as the sunlight at noon was ever so
much brighter than it was at morning or evening. Accordingly she
inquired of the ever ready Sign Post, as she had a vague idea that
the Wizard rather disliked being questioned.</p>

<p>It was immediately explained to her that the light was regulated
by means of many folds of soft gauze, which were operated
by means of ropes and pulleys and in as many thicknesses as were
required. They were also in various shades of yellow, pink and
violet and soft gray, so that a most beautiful twilight could at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
any time be had for the asking by simply arranging the gauze in
appropriate color and thickness.</p>

<p>It all seemed so simple that Sally was beginning to think the
Wizard had won his fame very easily. That personage, who had of
course felt obliged to give the most of his attention to the King
and Queen, now led the way down the narrow and winding stairs,
a journey which the Sign Post made in about half as many steps
with his long legs.</p>

<p>Very shortly they were back again in the big audience hall.
Everything was just as they had left it, the parrot still asleep and
hanging up like a bat by his claws, and the gargoyles both dozing,
one under the Wizard’s great chair and the other upon it, each
with one eye open.</p>

<p>Sally, who had noticed Bedelia’s somewhat hostile attitude, was
relieved to find all the creatures asleep. But they were not long
to remain so, for the noise made by the party in returning speedily
woke them. The parrot, with a shrill cry, flew straight to her
favorite perch on the back of her master’s chair. Being still half
asleep, she did not perceive the dear little pet that occupied it
until a lusty tug at her tail and the dreadful consciousness that she
had parted company with several of her best tail feathers caused her
to fly to the floor, squawking and chattering.</p>

<p>Immediately both the gargoyles gave chase, but Polly, far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
retreating, turned boldly to face her tormentors. In a moment Bedelia
had thrown herself into the thick of the fray and there ensued
a very bad quarter of an hour for everybody all around. Fur and
feathers flew and Polly, reinforced by Bedelia, would have scored
a signal victory owing to the fact that the gargoyles were tied up,
while the parrot, after delivering a series of blows with beak and
claws, could always get out of the range of their jaws. Finally the
Wizard, whom none of them seemed to mind the least bit, succeeded
in restoring order. The gargoyles were driven off to a far corner
where they were tied up in disgrace, and Polly, minus her tail
feathers, was shut up in her cage, squawking and protesting every
step of the way.</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime, Bedelia quickly secured the bone of contention,
namely the brilliant tail feathers, and stuck them into her fur behind
her ears, where they stood up impudently, giving her rather
the aspect of an Indian squaw.</p>

<p>Peace having been restored, afternoon tea was brought in and
served by a number of jumping-jacks, who were in fine livery and
powdered wigs. The jumping-jacks were exclusively in the service
of the Wizard and very fine servants they proved to be. To be sure,
one of them would occasionally collapse and fall in a limp heap on
the floor, scattering tea and cakes all over the place. But as jumping-jacks
usually do collapse and sprawl on the ground unless properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
held up by the string that always grows out of the tops of
their heads, nobody seemed to think anything of it, or to mind it
in the least.</p>

<p>It seemed rather a shame to Sally
that they should be compelled to wear
powdered wigs, thus covering
up forever that most
important string. The
poor creatures could
never be quite sure when
they were going to collapse.
Besides, what
a quantity of tea and
cakes was always being
wasted! She
could not exactly figure
it all out and confided her dilemma to the Sign Post.
He remarked that even were the powdered
wigs dispensed with, there would be
nobody to hold up the strings.</p>

<p>While this was very true, it did not help Sally in the least,
and she was rather glad when the Queen declared that it was time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to leave, and the whole party, having bade good-bye to the Wizard,
with thanks for the pleasant if somewhat strenuous visit, returned
to the palace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE WEATHER PROPHET</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-a.jpg" width="81" height="79" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">ALTHOUGH there was no night in Toyland, a species of
twilight prevailed after a certain hour, not dark enough
to require lights, but it still proved deliciously restful
after a day of perfect and brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>These twilights were, of course, engineered by the Wizard
from his tower, and by means of the gauze arrangements that the
Sign Post had explained to Sally, were blue, pink, yellow, green,
and so on, according to the fancy of the magician.</p>

<p>It was quite the fad to give afternoon teas that matched the twilight
in color, and as a bulletin was posted each morning at the
Wizard’s front door announcing the shade of the twilight to come,
the rest was an easy matter. As soon as the diminishing sunlight
proclaimed the approach of evening, myriads of fireflies were let
loose in all the rooms of the palace, furnishing all the light that was
necessary. Indeed, Toyland knew nothing of lamps or candles,
gas or electric light. The cooking was all done with fuel, the secret
of whose preparation was known to the Wizard alone. It
was non-explosive and burned without consuming away, so that one
good-sized chunk would last forever. In fact, when a person went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to invest in fuel, he first had his cook stove measured and then
ordered to be sent home a block of exactly the right dimensions.
When he wanted it lit all he had to do was to use the bellows that
hung by the side of every stove. This started the fire at once, and an
occasional application kept it going. When the bellows was hung
up for good, the fuel went out. In every kitchen was employed
a boy who did nothing but blow the fire with the bellows. With
such a state of affairs, conflagrations were unknown and, in fact, unheard
of. To be sure, there were plenty of iron fire companies who
appeared at intervals with other toys from the world of human beings,
but their occupation was gone forever, and they were obliged
to seek other pursuits, usually being given a place in the standing
army, a position for which their brilliant uniforms easily fitted them.</p>

<p>On this particular evening after returning from the Wizard’s
palace,—it was a pink evening, by the way—it was announced much
to Sally’s delight that the Weather Prophet had declared snow for
the following morning. If Sally was pleased, she was just as much
astonished, for the weather was warm and the month she was quite
sure was June. However, as the Wizard managed the Weather
Prophet, who was only his mouth-piece, nobody ever knew, it appeared,
what sort of weather might be expected within the next few
hours. The Queen suspected that snow had been ordered for
Sally’s benefit, and said so with a smile; while the King suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
that they should all go over to visit the Weather Prophet, as there
was nothing especially amusing laid out for the evening. This was
readily agreed to by everyone, and as soon as dinner was over they
all started forth to walk to the house of the personage who ruled
the weather.</p>

<p>The evening was beautiful. A rosy flush rested upon everything,
while every wayside tree was filled with fireflies. To be sure,
Bedelia declared that the pinkish glow made them all look as if they
had scarletina. But as nobody in Toyland had ever heard of such a
thing as scarletina, her joke fell very flat indeed.</p>

<p>A short walk brought them to the house of the Weather Prophet.
At one period of her life Sally would have called it a glass box, set
up on end. And that was certainly what it did look like. They
caught a glimpse of a mass of fluffy drapery within and then Bedelia
exclaimed in a tone of disappointment and chagrin, “Why, it’s nothing
but a paper doll!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, a paper doll it was, and a lady doll at that. Sally
had seen just such dolls hung upon her Christmas trees year after
year. In fact, she had often helped to make the fluffy skirts of
plaited crépe paper.</p>

<p>The Sign Post here whispered that the skirts were really the
most wonderful thing about the Weather Prophet, as they changed
color with the changes of the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally now observed hanging over the door a glass sign on which
was printed in large, golden letters</p>

<p class="center">
WHEN I WEAR PINK, A STORM IS DUE,<br />
WHEN SKIES ARE CLEAR, MY SKIRTS ARE BLUE.<br />
</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/illus110.jpg" width="354" height="441" alt="Woman in window with sign above" />
</div>

<p>In fact, the glass sign began to repeat the stanza in a very loud
voice as soon as the party
was within hailing
distance, and kept repeating
it over and
over until the
Weather Prophet
angrily ordered it to
be quiet, whereupon
it became so
sulky that it
clouded itself all
over and became
quite dim.</p>

<p>As soon as the
Weather Prophet could
make herself heard, she
greeted her guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with the greatest affability, and when questioned concerning the impending
storm replied by pointing with a smile to her draperies,
which certainly were as pink as could be.</p>

<p>“As there never is any rain here,” she explained, “a storm
usually—in fact, as a rule—means a snow storm.” Then with a
friendly nod at Sally, she added, “In your country, where I once
lived, you have many kinds of storms.”</p>

<p>To this Bedelia promptly responded before Sally had time to
answer, “Snow storms, hail storms, rain storms, thunder storms and
brain storms!”</p>

<p>“We have thunder storms here, too, but never any rain,” replied
the Weather Prophet.</p>

<p>She was very pretty, and confided to Sally that she was the
Wizard’s wife, but that as she had to remain where her draperies
could be influenced by the weather, she seldom went to the tower.</p>

<p>“Besides which, I cannot abide his horrid gargoyles,” she added,
with a contemptuous sniff.</p>

<p>Sally remembered how stuffy the big hall in the tower had been
and did not at all blame the pretty doll for preferring her own
bright and airy glass house with its many ventilators and the gay,
striped awnings that could be spread out when the sun was too
glaring.</p>

<p>As the neat, gold paper watch that the Weather Prophet wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at her belt now pointed to the hour of nine and Sally was beginning
to look tired, they all took leave of their charming hostess and
wended their way back to the palace, where the Queen with an affectionate
kiss dismissed Sally that she might seek the rest that she so
greatly needed.</p>

<p>“What on earth would nurse think if she could see us going
to bed at ten o’clock?” exclaimed the child, as she cuddled close
up to Bedelia, already half asleep on the dainty linen pillow.</p>

<p>“What would she think if she could see any of it, especially
the gargoyles?” returned the little bear sleepily.</p>

<p>Sally burst out laughing, remembering nurse’s dismay at sight
of one small mouse. But before her merry laugh had ceased to echo
through the room, her eyelids fell drowsily. She was fast asleep.</p>

<p>They slept long and soundly, and were at last awakened by the
scraping of shovels and the sound of carts and horses in the street
below. Quickly Sally sprang out of bed, followed by Bedelia, who
fell all over herself and very nearly upset Sally in her anxiety to get
to the window.</p>

<p>A strange sight met their eyes. In the street below were moving
back and forth a myriad of little carts, each drawn by one horse,
and presided over by a jumping-jack. But wonderful to relate,
instead of shoveling up the snow and carrying it away, the drivers
were unloading it as fast as they could and spreading it over everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Down the road and as far as she could see, the child beheld
a company of Sign Posts that were mounted on huge ladders and
busily engaged in sprinkling the snow over the tops and branches of
the stiff little trees. They also hung numbers of glittering icicles on
the boughs and twigs.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see any more, Sally dressed with the greatest
possible haste and flew to find her own especial Sign Post. Him
she found waiting patiently in the hall below, and in response to
her eager queries, he explained that, as Sally already knew, the
temperature in Toyland never varied. Therefore there was neither
rain nor real snow. The snow that now lay thickly spread over
everything was manufactured by the Wizard, who alone knew how
to make it.</p>

<p>“So you see,” concluded the Sign Post, “we can have winter
whenever Their Majesties wish for a sleigh ride.”</p>

<p>They were walking along the garden path by this time, the crisp
snow crunching under their feet. Sally thought that Toyland had
never looked so beautiful as now, with every tree and roof sparkling
with the glittering snow crystals. The child picked up a few icicles
and put them carefully into her pocketbook for future reference.
She felt very much puzzled to see such a topsy-turvy state of affairs
as existed in Toyland. The idea of snow being shoveled out of carts
instead of being shoveled into them! She could but reflect, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that a snow storm in the nursery must have been planned and executed
under very nearly the same circumstances.</p>

<p>“To be sure, they are only a lot of dolls,” she said to herself.
“No wonder that the Wizard is able to deceive them in so many
ways.”</p>

<p>“What becomes of all this stuff?” just then demanded Bedelia.
She had been digging down into the snow with much vigor and had
promptly discovered that it was neither cold nor wet.</p>

<p>“The snow,” replied the Sign Post with dignity, “is the property
of the Wizard. When it has lain here for what he considers
a proper length of time, his servants gather it up and cart it away
and it is stored up for future use.”</p>

<p>Just then a great jingling of bells was heard and a huge sleigh
came swinging up the driveway. In it was seated no less a personage
than the Polly-nosed Saphead himself, wrapped in furs and evidently
in a great state of pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p>The poll parrot was perched on the back of the seat, while much
to Sally’s dismay the ugly heads of the two gargoyles appeared poking
up from among the fur robes.</p>

<p>“Come for a sleigh ride,” cried the parrot before the Wizard
had time to move or speak. “Come for a sleigh ride, a sleigh ride,
a sleigh ride!” and she would no doubt have kept on repeating the
invitation indefinitely had not one of the gargoyles suddenly reared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
up on the back seat and made a grab for her brilliant tail. Whereupon
the Wizard felt obliged to interfere and it was some time before
peace was restored and the great man descended with as much
pomp and ceremony as the circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>He was such a bundle of furs that had it not been for his big
head, which was crowned with a large fur cap, it would have been
almost impossible to find his little shrunken body at all. He greeted
Sally with great warmth and announced that he had come to take
her and the royal party for a sleigh ride. Here Bedelia remarked
in a stage whisper that had the “royal party” been present, he would
not have put Sally first in his invitation. Nobody heeding her, however,
she proceeded to devote her attention to the parrot, the gargoyles
having been left outside in the sleigh.</p>

<p>While feeling rather doubtful about riding in the same vehicle
with the ugly beasts as well as Polly and Bedelia—for she knew
very well that they would all have to go along—Sally felt obliged
to accept so pressing an invitation, especially when offered by such
a mighty personage. And word was accordingly sent upstairs to
the King and Queen who presently came hurrying down, all ready
for the ride.</p>

<p>In the excitement everyone had forgotten about breakfast, that
is, everyone but Bedelia. She now dived below stairs and made a
swift raid on the dining-room, whence she shortly returned with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
evidence of having restored exhausted nature with a great number of
cookies, judging from the crumbs that adorned her fur.</p>

<p>As there was no further reason for delay, the whole party
climbed into the big sleigh. The Queen and Sally were on the back
seat with Bedelia between them, the King and the Wizard on the
front seat with Polly perched on the back of it directly behind her
master. The gargoyles were perched up in front with the driver,
much to the dismay of that dignified personage, who disliked them
heartily. Besides, he considered, and with some reason, that their
presence detracted in no small degree from his own liveried dignity.
However, he was too much afraid of them to vent his displeasure as
he might have done had they not been such ugly looking customers.
The footman, too, felt very much aggrieved at having his quarters
curtailed by the admission of such passengers. However, there was
no help for it, and each one being finally settled in his place, the
sleigh started off with a great jingling of bells and waving of plumes
that stood up stiffly on the heads of the mettlesome steeds and also
reared themselves aloft on the pillars of the high dashboard.</p>

<p>The Wizard remarked that he had invited his wife to come
along but that as she objected to so much live stock, she had preferred
to remain where she was. Sally wondered where the Weather
Prophet would have roosted had she accepted the Wizard’s invitation,
as there did not appear to be a square inch of unoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
room. However, she said nothing and the sleigh sped merrily along,
finally leaving the city and swinging out into the open country.</p>

<p>Here also winter fair and sparkling prevailed in all its dazzling
splendor. The King remarked that there would be fine skating to
which the Wizard replied that he had caused several pair of skates to
be brought along and that they would try the skating pond when the
ladies had had enough of the sleigh.</p>

<p>This proposition was hailed with delight by all concerned.
Sally could not help wondering where they were going to find any
ice. Her curiosity was presently satisfied when the sleigh drew up
beside a large sheet of clear glass, which had been lightly sprinkled
with the snow powder, so that it was not too slippery for roller skating.
Roller skating it was to which the Wizard now invited his
guests. And in a few moments they were all speeding merrily along,
each one trying to outstrip the others. Even the gargoyles each
buckled a pair of skates on his front and only paws, and joined the
merry company. And by dint of balancing themselves with their
wings, they managed very well indeed.</p>

<p>The Queen was highly delighted as the skating pond was something
entirely new, and the whole party remained circling round
and round until the Wizard, looking at his watch, suddenly declared
that it was high time for twilight and that although it greatly
grieved him to stop so delightful a diversion, he really must hasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
back to his tower in order to attend to the same. He added that
his wife desired the party to take tea with her and that it would be
a lavender tea.</p>

<p>Everybody now took off the roller skates and piled into the
sleigh, the homeward way being taken by a different route in order
that they might lose none of the beauties of the scenery.</p>

<p>As they approached the spot on which the pretty little glass
house of the Weather Prophet had stood, a cry of dismay broke from
the lips of all,—at least all but those of the Wizard. The house
was gone, and not the smallest trace of either house or Prophet
remained to tell the tale. Neither did the most systematic search
reveal anything. The baffled Wizard retired to his tower to consult
the stars, as he declared, while the rest of the party hurried to the
palace to get their own lavender tea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-g.jpg" width="96" height="85" alt="G" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">GREAT was the hue and cry raised over the disappearance
of the Weather Prophet, and dire the dismay of
the general public, that had daily flocked to the pretty
little glass house to learn the very latest advice from
the weather bureau. They greatly feared there could now be no
further predictions concerning sun and storm, for there never had
been but one Weather Prophet within the memory of anyone, even
the oldest of all. Even the Wizard knew nothing concerning the
material of which his wife’s magic skirts were made. A weather
prophet she had been, although badly in need of repair, upon her
arrival in Toyland, and her like had never been seen, would never
be seen again.</p>

<p>Queerer even than her disappearance seemed to Sally the vanishing
of her glass house. Perhaps, like the Walking House, it had
found feet and eloped, carrying off its owner, whether willing or
not. Even the loquacious glass sign was gone, which proved conclusively
to the logical mind of the Wizard, or at least he so expressed
himself, that the house had run away with the lady, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that at that very moment she was no doubt placidly following her
profession of prophesying in some far distant region.</p>

<p>Bedelia, as usual, had her own opinion concerning the matter,
and went about looking mysterious. Sally, who greatly feared that
the little bear was planning mischief, was much relieved when she
finally spoke her mind.</p>

<p>“I believe that bald-headed old terror knows where his wife
is,” she declared one morning while the two were wandering through
the palace greenhouses. “She had two pet Flussies and they are
gone, too. Now, even if she was carried off by her glass house
against her will, she could have sent them back with a message.
Anyway, it isn’t likely that she went of her own accord, for she is
so well known all over Toyland that wherever she went, the Wizard
would be sure to find it out and bring her back. Besides that, she
had no reason for running off. Everybody liked her and made a
fuss over her.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, whatever do you suppose has become of her?”
inquired Sally breathlessly. The child had had her own misgivings,
remembering the pretty doll’s dislike for her husband’s pets. “You
don’t suppose the gargoyles could have <i>eaten</i> her?” she added hurriedly.</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t believe the Polly flew away with her,” retorted
Bedelia scornfully. “I believe she is hidden somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
within a very short distance from here. The Wizard has some
motive for getting her out of the way. You know he said she had
refused to go sleighing with the rest of us. He probably said that
just for effect.”</p>

<p>“But what could he have done with the house?” demanded
Sally.</p>

<p>“Oh, that could easily have been taken to pieces and moved
away. He had those imps of gargoyles to help him,” replied the
little bear. Then after a moment’s thought, she added reflectively,
“As you know, the King and Queen have gone away on business
for a couple of days. Suppose we try to unravel this mystery all
by ourselves. I am sure the Sign Post will help us. He can run
very fast, besides being so tall he can get at almost anything. Of
course we won’t mention what we are doing to anyone. It may be
that I am on quite the wrong scent. But there’s no harm in trying.”</p>

<p>And Sally having given her delighted consent, Bedelia trotted
off to find the Sign Post, singing at the top of her voice</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The owl, and the eel, and the warming pan</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They went to call on the soap-fat man;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The soap-fat man he was not within</span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>This ancient classic somehow, it seemed to Sally, applied to
the situation in hand, only it was Sally and the Sign Post and Bedelia
instead of the owl and the eel and the warming-pan.</p>

<p>A bright idea suddenly struck the little girl, and she could
scarcely wait until Bedelia returned with the Sign Post to announce
it to them.</p>

<p>“Bedelia, dear,” she exclaimed, “if we are going to be real detectives,
we shouldn’t use our own names, because real detectives
never do. Let us call ourselves the Owl and the Eel and the Warming-Pan.
It will be so lovely and mysterious!”</p>

<p>Bedelia clapped her paws with delight at this proposition, while
the Sign Post beamed approval from his lofty height.</p>

<p>“With capitals, of course,” continued Sally. “And now which
of us shall be which?”</p>

<p>After some discussion, it was decided that Sally should be the
Owl (with a capital), Bedelia the Eel, while the long and lean
Sign Post should be the Warming-Pan.</p>

<p>This mighty problem having been settled, they proceeded to
hold a council of war and finally decided to set forth at once upon
their mission. They concluded to go on foot and, if it were not
possible to return each night to the palace, to remain wherever they
could find lodging. The Sign Post, while he had no opinion of
his own at all concerning the disappearance of the Weather Prophet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was glad to fall in with the plans of anyone who had, and Sally
perceived with delight that he was going to be a most valuable addition
to their detective force.</p>

<p>By noon their simple preparations were completed and they
set forth merrily enough, having concluded to go over the nearby
ground first, then if they discovered nothing to proceed to regions
more remote. Bedelia’s idea that the subject of their search was
hidden close by seemed sensible enough. She might be in the Wizard’s
tower for that matter. The disappearance of the house was
what bothered all of them. What use could anyone have for a
vanishing glass house? It was really most mysterious.</p>

<p>They walked on, discussing the subject that was so troubling
them when suddenly the sound of heavy paws padding along behind
them made them turn quickly. And they beheld hurrying along
after them a big, white figure that Sally recognized at once as the
large Polar Bear rug that lay at the side of the Queen’s bed. He
had come to life most beautifully and only flopped in a very small
degree, considering his boneless condition. He came up panting
a little and wagging his huge head amiably as is the fashion with
Polar Bears.</p>

<p>“I was <i>so</i> afraid you would get away!” he said in a panting
voice, as he linked arms with Sally and quickly fell into step with
her. Then he added, “Aren’t you surprised to see me? I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
did such a thing before. Ever since I can remember, I have lain
beside the Queen’s bed. But this morning I felt that I had reached
the limit. Do let me go along with you! I am thirsting for adventure.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you could walk so far?” said Sally, eyeing his
somewhat wabbly legs rather doubtfully. “Besides, what will the
Queen say when she returns?”</p>

<p>“I shall not be there to hear,” replied the Polar Bear solemnly.
“And as for walking, I can go along with the best of you. Besides,
you will find me very useful, for when you are tired, I will spread
myself out and you can rest comfortably on my long, soft hair.”
He smiled so amiably as he said this that the others at once consented
to take him along, and also informed him of the object of their
journey.</p>

<p>This confidence ended, they proceeded more briskly than before,
and soon the palace was left behind and they found themselves
in the open country. At the edge of the town Sally saw a most
peculiar looking tree whose queer leaves, some square, some oblong,
no two of them alike, were white instead of green, and rustled with
a sound like sweetest music as the wind whispered softly through
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a queer tree!” she exclaimed, hurrying toward it.</p>

<p>“That, my dear, is a letter tree,” said the Sign Post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“A letter tree?” replied the child blankly. “Then you have
no post-office in Toyland?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/illus125.jpg" width="374" height="475" alt="Sign Post pointing to tree of letters" />
</div>

<p>“I do not know what a post-office may be,”
replied the other.
“But here all our letters
grow on trees.
The loving thoughts
of our friends to
us, why should
they not bloom
and bear fruit,
the fruit of the
heart and brain?”</p>

<p>Much impressed
by the eloquence of her
companion, Sally was
silent, but Bedelia remarked
that she had
heard of a brain-storm,
but that brain-fruit was
one too many for her.</p>

<p>The Sign Post, without condescending to notice the little bear’s
impertinence, lifted Sally in his long arms so that she might more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
closely examine the wonderful tree, which she did with the greatest
curiosity. But although she sought all over it, there was no fruit
bearing her name. She had not expected anything, yet she somehow
felt disappointed. However, Bedelia was in the highest spirits,
having been lifted up by the Polar Bear, with whom she had struck
up the greatest friendship, and she could scarcely be restrained from
appropriating a number of letters, albeit they were all addressed
to other people.</p>

<p>Just as the Polar Bear was resolutely setting her down on her
feet, she made a sudden grab and descended to the ground with a
letter tightly clasped in her mischievous paw.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bedelia, how could you!” cried Sally in distress.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s for you, stupid!” retorted Bedelia saucily, as she
thrust the envelope under Sally’s nose. Sure enough it was, and
Sally had somehow overlooked it. It was addressed in a manner
not to be mistaken:</p>

<p class="center">
To Sally,<br />
<br />
Care of Her Royal Highness,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The Palace,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">Toyland.</span><br />
</p>

<p>“How curious!” cried Sally as she eagerly tore it open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>It read thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Dear Sally</span>:—

<p>Here I am shut up in the tower by that horrid old Polly-nosed Saphead. He
sent for me yesterday on the pretense that he wanted me to go sleigh-riding, and
when he got me up here in the very top of the tower, he locked me in and went away.
He has left the gargoyles outside the door and I can hear them scratching and fussing
around. I don’t know what he is doing this for, but anyway he has gone off on
business with the King and Queen and I want you to bring help at once and let me
out. I know how to get even with him. Do hurry, dear Sally.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours in prison,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">The Weather Prophet</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you so?” exclaimed Bedelia after a moment of
stupefied silence. And then she added briskly, “There’s no use
standing here staring like a lot of gawks. The thing to do is to
hurry back home and get the Weather Prophet out of prison.”</p>

<p>To this all eagerly assented, and Sally fancied that she heard
the Sign Post murmur faintly, “Five miles to the palace.” Whether
or not this was true, they had come a goodly distance and were all
more or less tired, so that rest and refreshment were really necessary
before starting back on their homeward journey. Therefore they
seated themselves under the beautiful letter tree and ate the dainty
food that had been put up for them by the obliging cook before
they left the palace. There were chicken sandwiches, deviled eggs,
thin slices of cold ham and tongue, and a beautiful salad of lettuce
and celery in a bowl. And for dessert was a fine strawberry tart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
covered with whipped cream and a number of most tempting little
cakes. There was also a jug of lemonade.</p>

<p>The Sign Post, who had obligingly carried all these dainties
dangling from one of his long arms, helped to spread the feast and
then sat down contentedly to his own meal of shavings, which, as
he now explained, constituted his regular fare. The only variety
consisted in the fact that they were obtained from different woods,
each of which possessed its own peculiar flavor.</p>

<p>The meal at last being ended, Sally and Bedelia cleared the
remains of it away, and as all felt thoroughly rested, they concluded
to start back at once to the palace. As all roads in Toyland lead to
the palace, they simply proceeded on their way instead of retracing
their steps. Sally and the Sign Post led the way, while Bedelia
trotted contentedly along with the Polar Bear.</p>

<p>Presently through a break in the trees they caught a gleam of
something that glistened like ice in the cold sunshine.</p>

<p>“The lake!” cried Sally. “If we only had our skates and plenty
of time, what fun we might have.”</p>

<p>To which the Polar Bear responded rather severely, “Whoever
heard of a rescue party stopping to go skating?”</p>

<p>And as this was very true, Sally remained silent, although feeling
rather hurt that the Polar Bear should have taken her up so
suddenly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/illus129.jpg" width="253" height="504" alt="Sign Post holding bear up to tower window" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>They were now directly on the edge of the lake, and as she
gazed down upon its glistening glass surface that gleamed with a
hundred rainbow tints, Sally suddenly uttered a loud exclamation,
“The Weather Prophet’s glass house!” she cried
excitedly. “The Wizard used it to make this lake.
He carried her off and shut her up because he
knew she would object to having it pulled to
pieces and made into a lake!”</p>



<p>And indeed the truth of her assertion
proved itself at once to the minds
of all present, for the lake had been
laid in sections and one could discern
plainly enough where the top
and sides of the house were
joined so as to make one flat surface.
Even the pretty striped
awnings of red and white had
been utilized in the construction
of a tent, under which the skaters
had rested when weary with their
exertions.</p>

<p>Indignation at the meanness of the
crafty old Wizard and sympathy for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pretty little wife was expressed by all, and they at once hastened
forward, more resolved than ever to rescue her from the clutches of
the Wizard, or to perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>They made very good time, the Sign Post carrying Sally and
Bedelia turn and turn about when either felt tired. But it was
near the hour for twilight before the towers and gables of the royal
palace came into view. Sally suddenly remembered that in the
absence of the Wizard there would probably be no twilight, a fact
that she had not before thought of. They would have to do their
work in broad daylight. However, they hurried along and were
soon in the grounds of the Wizards palace.</p>

<p>High up in the tip-top window of the lofty tower they saw
fluttering a tiny white object that was evidently the handkerchief
of the poor little prisoner, for having seen them she was waving it
frantically.</p>

<p>All was silent and deserted. The Wizard had locked up everything
securely and had given a holiday to his servants, fearing that
they might notice the effort of his prisoner to make herself heard,
which effort she was pretty certain to make. Consequently the little
party had nothing to fear in the way of encountering guards. How
to effect an entrance was, however, quite another matter, for everything
was bolted, barred and padlocked. The problem was finally
solved by the Sign Post, who stood on his very tiptoes and triumphantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
boosted Bedelia in at the third story window, which had
been left open as being too high up to offer a means of egress for the
prisoner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE ECLIPSE</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-o.jpg" width="83" height="81" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">ONCE inside, Bedelia quickly gave a hand to Sally and
in a moment the little girl, lifted up by the Sign Post,
stood beside the small bear. The Sign Post now swiftly
swung himself up to the balcony, being assisted in no
small degree by the Polar Bear, who for various reasons remained
below. He was to keep watch and give notice if anyone approached.</p>

<p>It was now arranged that as the Sign Post was far too tall to
navigate around inside of the house, he should climb from one balcony
to another until he reached the top and if possible effect the
rescue of the Wizardess from the outside. This seemed very satisfactory
to Sally and Bedelia, neither of whom exactly liked the idea
of encountering the gargoyles which they knew were wandering
about, unfettered, in the dark halls.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/illus133.jpg" width="263" height="452" alt="Sally hanging on Sign Post as he climbs tower" />
</div>

<p>Anxiously they waited, watching the long legs of the Sign Post
as they trailed over the edge of the upper railing. Then they disappeared
and all was painful suspense for what seemed at least a
century. Then at a shout from the Polar Bear they both rushed
out on the balcony. They beheld the Sign Post swinging himself
swiftly down from balcony to balcony, which he appeared to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the utmost ease and looking more like a big spider than anything
else—all legs and arms. Clinging to his neck was the Weather
Prophet, her fluffy skirts flying every which way in
the fine breeze. Presently he had reached the
ground and having gently set his fair burden
down, he quickly scrambled back
again and hastened to bring down
Sally and Bedelia, who were beginning
to feel a wee bit nervous
as they had tried the door of the
room in which they were and
had found it locked on the outside.
And right thankful they
were to find themselves on the
green grass below, comforting the
little Weather Prophet, who was
overjoyed to find herself at liberty.</p>

<p>Where she should go was the next
question. The Wizard might return at
any moment, and her own house was a house
no longer. Suddenly an expression of delight flashed over Sally’s
face.</p>

<p>“Let us go to the Walking House!” she exclaimed. “You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be quite safe there and if anyone comes in pursuit, the house can
easily escape with you.”</p>

<p>To this the Weather Prophet gave a joyful assent.</p>

<p>“Let us go quickly, quickly!” she cried. “I feel it in my bones,
in my skirts, I mean, that we are going to have something very unusual.
In fact, according to the calculations, we are going to have
an eclipse of the sun in about a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>Here she winked at Bedelia with a gesture so comical that the
little bear rolled over laughing.</p>

<p>“Come, don’t let us delay,” exclaimed the rescued one, and
hand in hand they hurried away from the Wizard’s tower, which
was soon completely obscured from view by the thick trees that
surrounded it.</p>

<p>At the edge of the park they paused and as the distance to the
Walking House was several miles, The Sign Post suggested that he
should procure a conveyance and also some wraps for the Weather
Prophet in order that none might recognize her. Accordingly he
disappeared swiftly and soon returned with one of the autos from
the royal garage. As for Sally, Bedelia and the Weather Prophet,
you could never have told one from the other in their coats and
goggles, while the Polar Bear cuddled around their feet, thus keeping
them nice and warm.</p>

<p>Away they flew, the Sign Post for once in his life perched next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the chauffeur with his long legs doubled up as much as possible and
the rest of them hanging over the dashboard. The chauffeur was
an old oyster, who had been chosen for this capacity because he was
<i>dumb</i>, and could not voice his suspicions provided he felt any.</p>

<p>As the Walking House stood on the very edge of the town, it
took at least fifteen minutes to reach it, and although the chauffeur
made good speed, just as they were drawing up in front of it, darkness,
sudden, swift and ominous, fell upon Toyland.</p>

<p>It was altogether a hopeless darkness, for which the inhabitants
of Toyland were totally unprepared. Lamps and candles were unknown
and the people crouched in their gay little houses panic-stricken.</p>

<p>Only in the Walking House did lights appear, for in accordance
with custom, candles and candelabra adorned mantels and tables,
and it was the work of only a moment to light them all. Gaily
Sally and her party hurried into the house, Sally racing downstairs
to find Dinah, for they were all as hungry as wolves, while Bedelia
escorted the guest of honor upstairs to remove her wraps.</p>

<p>The Polar Bear stretched himself before the front door, making
a very effectual guard in case of danger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/illus136.jpg" width="497" height="584" alt="Three dolls including a Shepherdess and China maiden" />
<div class="caption">The dolls had come down into the parlor to be introduced to the
new arrivals.</div>
</div>

<p>At Sally’s suggestion, all the shades were drawn down so that
no ray of light might pierce the outer darkness—darkness that covered
everything like a muffling cloak, in which the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Toyland were helplessly floundering about, and which was sure to
last until the Wizard came back to set things straight.</p>

<p>“And a fine time he’ll have doing it,” remarked the Weather
Prophet with a toss of her pretty little head. “He won’t be able
to see his hand before his face, and I took care to leave his old electric
machines in such a muddle that he’ll have his hands full—fuller
than they’ve ever been with all the cares of state included.”</p>

<p>Sally, who had suspected as much, tried to reprove her, but
ended by laughing outright. The Weather Prophet was so very
like Bedelia when in her impish moods.</p>

<p>As for Bedelia herself, the idea tickled her so that she laughed
until she rolled off the sofa on which she had been sitting and proceeded
to bounce up and down on the floor like a fat rubber ball.
Then as soon as she was able to get her breath, she sat up, panting
and rubbing the tears out of her eyes with both paws.</p>

<p>“My face is leaking! I must be turning into a gargoyle,” she
exclaimed, which of course started everybody laughing all over
again.</p>

<p>By this time all the dolls had come crowding down into the
parlor to be introduced to the new arrival. Sally did not consider
it wise to introduce the Weather Prophet by her real name, feeling
that if a strict investigation should be made, it would be safer if
none of the dolls were aware of her identity. So it was that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was known to the inhabitants as Nellie, a name that had suggested
itself to Bedelia.</p>

<p>Sally feared that her own disappearance and that of Bedelia
would be connected with that of the Wizard’s wife, and therefore
resolved to take every precaution. The eclipse of course would retard
any search that the Wizard might see fit to make. But what
to do with the fugitive lady for the rest of her life was a question.
She flatly declared she would never return to the Wizard and was
wild with rage when she learned the use to which her pretty little
glass house had been put.</p>

<p>While all the pleasant acquaintance-making was going on in
the Walking House, an automobile containing a badly rattled
Wizard was slowly picking its way along through the inky blackness.
The old gentleman was shrewd enough to guess the cause
of the eclipse, although he had been quite sure in the beginning that
his wife was locked up too securely to be able to get at anything.
He had started forth at once, greatly against the wishes of the King
and Queen who, of course, could not understand the cause of his
anxiety, and who much preferred to stay behind until the sun shone
again. But the Wizard had taken immediate flight, and was now
hurrying back to his tower as rapidly as circumstances and the
eclipse would permit. On the principle that all roads led to the
palace, the chauffeur kept straight on through the pitch darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
tooting his horn occasionally to prevent a collision with any other
eclipse-belated wayfarer who might be floundering about on the
same road.</p>

<p>The snow made it somewhat difficult and altogether the trip
was anything but a pleasant one, and the Polly-nosed Saphead was
glad indeed when he at last found himself in front of his gloomy
tower. Instead of stopping there, however, he ordered the chauffeur
to go on to the palace, much to the dismay of that personage, who
considered that he had already traveled far enough. Nevertheless
he put on speed and soon arrived at the royal residence.</p>

<p>Here the Wizard quickly alighted and hastened into the palace.
He was gone some time and the chauffeur was growing very impatient
when he at last reappeared, triumphantly bearing in his hands
a large wicker cage in which were gleaming and glowing all the
fireflies that were accustomed always to be liberated at twilight.
He chuckled to himself as he was whirled back to his tower, and
in a few moments was inside and hastening toward the room that
contained his electric plant.</p>

<p>The gargoyles came hurrying down to meet him, and it was a
very good thing that he carried a light, for had they caught him
alone in the darkness, they would no doubt have made a meal of
him. As it was, they recognized him at once and came flapping
joyously along with hoarse growls of welcome. But the Wizard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
now had no time to waste on his pets. Pushing them roughly aside,
he dove into his laboratory and after one look around, sank upon a
chair with a groan that the gargoyles heard as they crouched against
the door in the darkness outside, and to which they replied with
sharp growls.</p>

<p>Everywhere reigned confusion worse confounded. Wires were
cut, batteries disconnected, wreck and ruin faced him on every side.
The Wizard smote his breast and fairly wept with rage.</p>

<p>“Call me the Wizard of Was,” he ejaculated, “for nobody but
a good-for-nothing old back number would have gone off and left
that minx to get in her fine work here.”</p>

<p>“The Wizard of Was! The Wizard of Was!” a mocking
voice cried out of the darkness. And the terrified Wizard jumped
to his feet, while a peal of unearthly laughter rang through the room.
The next moment he sat down again, much relieved. The parrot
had fluttered in after him quite unobserved, and, perched on the
high mantel-shelf, was imitating her master at pleasure. Hearing
the familiar voice, the gargoyles began to scratch and snarl at the
door. They considered it very unfair that the parrot should be
allowed inside while <i>they</i> were banished to outer darkness.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” he commanded, fiercely throwing his words at the
parrot like shots from a gun. And then, “Lie down there, will
you?” this accompanied with a vigorous slap applied to the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
his head, for his scalp-lock had suddenly lifted itself erect and was
standing straight up in the air.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illus142.jpg" width="345" height="412" alt="Wizard looking grumpy" />
</div>

<p>“You don’t like the looks of things, hey? Well, I don’t either.
But just mind your own affairs. I’ll attend to
the rest.” Then
pulling himself vigorously
together, he
set to work to repair
the damage as best he
could, although he
foresaw plenty of
hard work ahead of
him before the sun
could shine out again.
Right well he knew that
his reputation as a wizard
would be gone forever did the
present state of affairs continue for any
length of time, and while he worked, he
concocted a story which he intended to give out to the public on the
morrow.</p>

<p>As far as his wife was concerned, he had no doubt that she
was wandering about in the upper darkness at the very top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
tower, for it never occurred to him that she could have escaped.
He supposed that she had merely climbed out of one window and
into another, and so effected an entrance to his rooms where was
kept all the electric machinery with which he manipulated the sun.</p>

<p>While he was fussing and fuming, raging at the parrot and
scolding the gargoyles, his pretty little wife was in close confab with
Sally and Bedelia.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly understand about that letter tree,” Sally remarked,
as she softly scratched the little bear’s fuzzy ears and at
the same time gently patted Nellie’s little hand that lay upon her
knee.</p>

<p>The three were stretched cosily on the Polar Bear rug in front
of the glowing grate, having put on kimonos and let down their
back hair—at least, all but Bedelia who wore her usual fur costume.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” replied the Weather Prophet, “you see we
have no postal system such as yours, and indeed it is quite unnecessary.
Whenever we want to communicate with anyone, we simply
think our message just as hard as we can, and very shortly our
thoughts burst forth into buds and blossoms on one of our letter
trees. There are quite a good many of them in Toyland.”</p>

<p>“And how does your friend know?” inquired Sally.</p>

<p>“Oh, one’s friend always has an impression that a letter is
waiting. You had one, although you didn’t know it, or you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
not have taken the road to the letter tree,” replied the Weather
Prophet.</p>

<p>“How very wonderful!” exclaimed the child, while Bedelia, who
had been rubbing her head gently against Sally, remarked that it
certainly made a wonderful saving in stamps and stationery.</p>

<p>“And there is one thing I have to confess,” went on the Weather
Prophet, suddenly holding up a small, glittering object which Sally
at once recognized as her little golden key. “Had it not been for
this, I never could have gained access to all the private rooms and
closets of the Wizard’s tower, although I climbed out of my own
window and in at his. The gargoyles, whom you know I fear and
despise, were loose in the hall outside my door so I had to choose
the other way.”</p>

<p>“But how did you get the key?” demanded the little girl, as
she smilingly hung it on her gold chain and replaced the two around
her neck. “I never missed it,” she added.</p>

<p>“You dropped it the day you were in my house, and I fancied,
as soon as I saw it, that it was a magic key. Of course, I meant to
return it the very next time I saw you, but no opportunity offered.
Take good care of it, my dear. It is a wonderful little talisman.”</p>

<p>Sally nodded assent to this and presently all three, being tired
out with the day’s adventures, tumbled into bed, Sally feeling delighted
to be back once more in her own cosy little room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>SALLY FINDS THE ENCHANTED WOOD</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capital-i.jpg" width="82" height="81" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IT took nearly two days for the Wizard to get things in
the tower once more into proper shape and during all
that time the eclipse hung heavily over Toyland. The
Wizard had worked feverishly with no light save that
obtained from the fireflies that he had stolen from the palace. He
was shaking in his shoes for fear the King and Queen should return
and find that the only source of illumination had been cut off. As
not even the wireless telegraph was working, he had been unable to
communicate with Their Majesties, but feared that they must be
very impatient by this time and that they might make their appearance
at any moment.</p>

<p>It was difficult to get on with only the light afforded by the
fireflies, and he chuckled grimly as he pictured the Weather Prophet,
who had so reveled in the sunshine of her glass house, pining in
the darkness in which he supposed she was locked up.</p>

<p>The room in which he had left her was on the opposite side of
the tower, and he had only to cross the hall to reach it, but he
savagely vowed to himself that he would not go near her, and that
he didn’t care if she starved to death. After a while, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
extreme quiet got on his nerves, and he began to wonder how it
was that no sound at all came to him from the room across the hall.
Presently he tiptoed very softly to the door and listened. But all
was still as could be—nothing moved or breathed.</p>

<p>He went back to his work, but a feeling of uneasiness possessed
him. The Queen was very fond of his pretty wife, and he knew
that he would be called to strict account should he be the cause of
any ill befalling her. After a little while he went back again and
listened, but still he could hear nothing. After a moment of hesitation,
he opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>By the radiance afforded by the fireflies, he saw at once that
the room was empty. Even the food that he had left there was
untouched. A hurried visit to all the other rooms on the floor failed
to discover the object of his search. Really terrified, he sat down
to consider. Suppose she had thrown herself down from the balcony,
and was at that moment laying on the ground below, dashed
to pieces! He had not the courage to go and investigate. For
like most people who brag a great deal about themselves, the Wizard
was an arrant coward. He fled back to his work, stopping not for
food or rest, with the result that on the morning of the third day
the sun shone brilliantly once more over Toyland.</p>

<p>A great notice was posted at the gate of the tower, announcing
that the sun had been swallowed up by an enormous dragon known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to science as the Ictotherium; that the Wizard had engaged him,
single-handed, and by his magic arts had compelled him to disgorge
his brilliant meal and flee the country.</p>

<p>The bulletin went on to state that the Weather Prophet had
been carried away by the dragon. Prompted by curiosity, she had
exposed herself on the high balcony at the top of the tower, contrary
to the advice of her husband. The notice concluded with the
announcement that there would be a purple twilight that afternoon,
beginning promptly at five-thirty and advising that violets would be
a suitable adornment for the afternoon tea tables.</p>

<p>Great was the grief expressed by everyone when the fate of the
Wizard’s pretty little wife became generally known, for she had
been a general favorite. Indeed, public sorrow almost outweighed
public joy, delighted as everyone was that the sun shone once more.
The Wizard shut himself up in his tower and refused to see anyone,
and the general supposition was that he was prostrated with grief.
To tell the truth, his jumping-jacks were scouring the country to
see if they could discover any trace whatsoever of his wife, while
he himself was nearly wild with anxiety lest she should suddenly
pop up at some unlucky moment and give the whole thing away.</p>

<p>Early that morning Sally had started for the tower, as she knew
that a bulletin of some sort would be posted. The little girl was
glad to see daylight once more and also to be able to take a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
long walk, and she skipped along in the bright sunshine, occasionally
giving a little jump for sheer joy. The period of the eclipse had
been a tedious one for her, as she despised being shut in the house.
So now she made very good time along the highway, and so thoroughly
did she manage to interest herself in everything and everybody
that before very long she found that she had lost her way.</p>

<p>Now, of course in Toyland it is not such a very serious thing
to lose one’s way, for as everybody knows, all roads lead to the palace.
However, Sally was greatly surprised to suddenly find herself in a
little strip of woods, with no road at all visible in any direction,
and without even a path to show the way that others had taken.
She recollected having left the highway to run after a queer looking
figure that had attracted her attention and which had kept just
beyond her, dodging along behind trees and bushes. And then,
just as she had come up to it, had vanished as completely as though
the ground had swallowed it. And then she had awakened to the
fact that she was lost.</p>

<p>“How provoking!” she said crossly to herself. “If I ever get
hold of the animal that coaxed me in here, I’ll show him what’s
what.”</p>

<p>She had spoken out loud, and at the same time shook her little
fist in a decidedly threatening manner.</p>

<p>“I’m no animal, I’ll have you know,” exclaimed a shrill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
squeaky voice so close to her that she jumped at least a foot in the
air.</p>

<p>And whirling around, she beheld just at her elbow the queerest
little man that she had ever laid eyes on. He was white all over,
with floppy arms and legs, and a squatty, flabby body and a head
that wabbled. And he had a general appearance of being all tied
up in knots. It was the creature that she had been following to her
own undoing, and for a moment she glared at it as if she would fall
upon it tooth and nail. The very next she fell to laughing as if
she would burst.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/illus150.jpg" width="471" height="601" alt="Sally talking to Handkerchief man" />
<div class="caption">“Oh, I know you! You are just tied out of a handkerchief.”</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, I know you!” she exclaimed breathlessly. “You are just
tied out of a handkerchief. I have often made a lot of you at home
to hang over the chandelier with long strings. And when I pulled
the strings you danced.”</p>

<p>“I do not know where home may be,” returned the Handkerchief
Man crossly, “but I do know that you never pulled any strings
as far as I am concerned.” Then he added, peering anxiously about,
“Have you happened to see my brother, the Doughnut Man? He
came here yesterday to pick buttons which he sells to the people in
town who are too lazy to come out and pick them for themselves.”</p>

<p>“To pick buttons?” ejaculated Sally, and then she added severely,
“I don’t believe he ever found this place while the eclipse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a><br /><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a><br /><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was going on. Nobody could have found anything, not even himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it; he lost himself. Nobody ever finds this place
unless he loses himself. That makes it even, you know. You’re
lost, I’m lost, my brother is lost, and the Peppermint Stick is lost.
Everybody is lost.”</p>

<p>Sally felt unable to contradict him, although she wanted to
badly enough. Therefore she demanded with some asperity:</p>

<p>“What is the Peppermint Stick? It sounds good to me.”</p>

<p>“You mean <i>who</i> is the Peppermint Stick. Well, he was a
candy cane in his youth and hung on a Christmas tree. Oh, you’ll
be sure to like him, he’s so sweet.”</p>

<p>“If I happen to see a doughnut and a candy cane anywhere between
here and next Christmas, I shall eat them,” declared Sally
firmly.</p>

<p>She drew up her pink lips in a hungry grin, showing all her
sharp little white teeth.</p>

<p>The effect of her words on the Handkerchief Man was entirely
unexpected, for after gazing at her for a moment as if fascinated,
he exclaimed feebly, “Alas, my brother!” then threw up
his wabbly arms and fell over in a dead faint.</p>

<p>“Now, what would anybody do with a thing like that?” exclaimed
Sally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Picking up the Handkerchief Man, she shook him vigorously,
but as he refused to revive, while every bit of him flopped unpleasantly,
she presently propped him up against a tree and started off
by herself, resolved to investigate the queer bit of woods which
nobody ever found without first losing himself.</p>

<p>“The very idea of a handkerchief behaving like that!” she said
to herself as she trotted along, keeping an eye open for the button
bush concerning which she had already heard. But no sign of it
appeared, neither did she find herself any nearer to the road. On
the contrary, she seemed to be getting deeper and deeper into the
woods. The trees grew closer and closer together, while the bushes
seemed thicker and thicker. At last it seemed that there was no
longer even a little path between the dense growths and that if she
wished to proceed further, she must push her way through. As she
paused for a moment to consider, something small and very hard
struck her smartly on the nose. This blow was followed up by another
and another. Thoroughly astonished, she stopped and picked
up one of the missiles that lay shining directly at her feet. Then
she uttered a little exclamation of joy:</p>

<p>“The Button Bush!” she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Button Bush,” retorted a voice above her head, and
the Bush shook itself again indignantly, sending a shower of the
buttons of all sizes and descriptions pelting over the little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you please,” began Sally rather timidly, “if you please,
have you seen the Doughnut Man anywhere about?”</p>

<p>Just as she spoke a queer looking figure came swiftly around
from the other side of the bush. Sally saw that its body was composed
of large, puffy doughnuts, while his head and limbs were
formed of the same edibles in smaller sizes. It was almost staggering
under the weight of a great basket of buttons that it was lugging
along, while its round eyes, which consisted of two plump
raisins, seemed popping out of its head with the exertion.</p>

<p>“He looks good to me. I wonder how he tastes,” said Sally
to herself, involuntarily taking a step forward. But the Doughnut
Man, holding his basket of buttons firmly in front of himself as if
it were a shield, advanced smiling and not at all as if he had any
idea of being devoured.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but did you happen to see the Peppermint
Stick anywhere hereabouts?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>“No, but I found the Handkerchief Man. He fainted,” returned
Sally promptly. “I couldn’t bring him to and I was afraid
to shake him any more for fear he would come untied, and then he
would have been nothing but a plain handkerchief. So I propped
him up against a tree and left him. No doubt he is all right by
this time. Would you like to go back and see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” returned the other quickly. “You see, we are both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
lost, you and I, or we shouldn’t be here at all. So what is the use of
looking for that peevish chap? He has very little backbone anyway.
Very little backbone,” he repeated sadly, while a tear rolled
down his crisp, fried cheek.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,” began Sally. But
her companion interrupted her with a great want of manners.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing has anything to do with anything else here, because
everything is lost, more or less. As soon as anything finds
itself, it gets away. So will you and so will I and so will the Peppermint
Stick.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, how very curious! Are you quite sure that you
are not all crazy instead of being all lost?” exclaimed Sally saucily.</p>

<p>“Maybe <i>you</i> are crazy, although I don’t know what that means,”
replied the other sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t stop to explain now. It would take too long,”
returned the child smartly, “but if you ever come across it, you’ll
know. Anyway, if you had your brother here now, you could mop
up your tears with him,” and as she spoke, she dexterously flipped
away a large, round one that hung trembling on the very end of the
Doughnut Man’s stubby nose.</p>

<p>“There you go again! Really, it’s very upsetting when one
doesn’t understand a thing you mean. Then there’s the Button Bush.
She’s mad again because I came for more buttons. What good are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
buttons on a bush, anyway? They’ve got to be picked while they’re
ripe or else they all go to seed. Really, it’s very unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have a good trade in buttons,” suggested the little
girl politely. “But who, pray, is the Peppermint Stick? Is he good
to e—” She caught herself hastily, somehow feeling that the Doughnut
Man would be displeased by what she had been on the verge
of saying. Something under her apron warned her that it must be
near lunch time, for her breakfast had been but a light one, and then
she was <i>very</i> fond of peppermint.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I have a very good trade,” replied the Doughnut
Man. “Only it would be more congenial if the Button Bush would
quit giving herself such ridiculous airs. As for the Peppermint
Stick, he isn’t good for anything in particular as far as I know. Long
ago he was a cane and was hooked on the bough of a Christmas
tree. Nobody ate him and he had a bad fracture, the result of being
dropped. So in the course of time, he drifted here and the Gloo-Gloos
fixed him up. The only thing I don’t like about him is that
he is striped. Now I simply abominate stripes, although I adore
polka dots. But tastes differ. Perhaps you like stripes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind them at all in peppermint,” replied Sally. “And
I would show him that I didn’t if I only could get my teeth into
him,” she added to herself.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we had better try to find our way out of this,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
said the other after a short silence. He was evidently anxious to get
back to town with his stock in trade and Sally was growing extremely
hungry. Accordingly, the two started forth and after wandering
along for some time at length discovered a little beaten track
which gradually broadened until it finally became a footpath.</p>

<p>This, they felt quite sure, would conduct them to their desired
destination. As they were hurrying along, they suddenly came upon
a little cottage so completely hidden among the trees that it was
scarcely discernible.</p>

<p>“Ah, now I know where we are! This cottage belongs to an
old Codfish. He makes his living by weighing people at so much
apiece.”</p>

<p>“By weighing people?” cried Sally in amazement. “Does anybody
ever come here?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” replied the other promptly. “But then he has the
<i>scales</i>, and of course feels as if he should use them.”</p>

<p>“Very scrupulous, I’m sure,” said Sally gravely. She strained
her eyes, hoping to catch a glimpse of the conscientious Codfish. But
everything about the tiny cottage was tightly closed, and an air of
desertion hung about the place. Over the door hung a small sign on
which was inscribed in tall letters:</p>

<p class="center">
PEOPLE WEIGHED HERE.<br />
C. FISH.<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>and below this was the picture of a Codfish standing by a pair of
scales, while a crowd of people were advancing in the foreground,
all apparently anxious to avail
themselves of the opportunity.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/illus158.jpg" width="324" height="503" alt="Sally and Doughnut man looking at Codfish" />
</div>

<p>As Sally and the Doughnut Man
came abreast of the sign, the
child was almost paralyzed
with amazement to see the
Codfish nimbly hop off, followed
by the scales and all
the people, and come running
briskly towards
them.</p>

<p>“I’ve stood up there
vegetating long enough,”
cried the Codfish.
“And I’m actually perishing
for want of a swim.
No one wants to be
weighed anyhow. Why should
they?”</p>

<p>He shot out the question with so impressive, not to say ferocious
a manner that nobody cared to answer. Only one member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
crowd that had hopped off the sign protested feebly that he had been
waiting for a long time. However, as nobody paid any attention to
him, he soon relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>“If you know the way out of these woods, for goodness’ sake
show us,” exclaimed the Doughnut Man.</p>

<p>To which the Codfish responded by beginning to sing in a very
loud voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The elephant sat on the railroad track,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By the light, by the light, by the light of the moon,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Picking his teeth with a baseball bat,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By the light, by the light of the moon.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,” exclaimed Sally impatiently.
Then turning to the Doughnut Man, she added severely,
“You said just now that you knew where we were, and you don’t at
all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure I do, and so do you. We are right opposite the
Codfish’s house,” retorted the other. Then he added thoughtfully,
“What seems so very queer to me is that we haven’t come across the
Peppermint Stick.”</p>

<p>As nobody cared a snap about the Peppermint Stick and as Sally
felt that there was no use in arguing with any of them, she suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that they should make a move, and herself taking the lead,
they started forth in Indian file.</p>

<p>“Idiots!” muttered the little girl to herself. “To think that
they’ve lived here all their lives and don’t know anything about the
place!”</p>

<p>She hurried along at such a brisk pace that the others found
some difficulty to keep up, especially the Doughnut Man, burdened
as he was by his huge basket of buttons. After they had gone a mile
or so, the little girl suddenly uttered a cry of joy, for she beheld an
opening in the trees and saw that a few steps would bring them to
the edge of the wood. Upon emerging from the dense shadows of
the trees, they found that it was already twilight and Sally no longer
wondered at her ravenous appetite.</p>

<p>Once on the highroad, it was easy enough to find the way home,
and hither she hastened, feeling glad enough when she beheld the
lights of the Walking House through the shadows.</p>

<p>The Weather Prophet ran to meet her, her face sparkling with
excitement.</p>

<p>“The King and Queen have been here,” she cried, “and they
were so delighted to find that I was not devoured by a horrid dragon
that they are going to take me to live with them at the palace, and
build a beautiful crystal tower for my use exclusively.”</p>

<p>She then told Sally of the Wizard’s bulletin and added that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he had humbly begged her pardon and promised never to interfere
with her again, she had not betrayed him to the King and Queen.</p>

<p>“I guess that was the best thing to do,” said Sally, as she sat
down to a substantial supper. “Nobody else understood about the
sun and a perpetual eclipse would have been perfectly awful.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” returned the Weather Prophet, and after a little,
Sally having related the day’s adventures, they all went to bed.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
